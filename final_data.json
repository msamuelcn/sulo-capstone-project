{"content":{"939":"Gcash has so much potential. However, if one can not do a cash-in, it is useless. Globe premium retailers refuse gcash transactions. The app has said temporary unavailable due to maintenance for 7-11 cash in options for multiple days. In the Bukidnon area the wide spread occurrence of groups that are suppose to support gcash yet refuse the transactions is a major the problem. If one can not easily load (cash-in) the gcash wallet, the app & service then become useless.","1158":"This app made my life much easier when it comes to paying bills, transferring money to more than 30 banks (yes no enrollment needed), sending money, buying loads, etc. I dont need to go out just to do those things which saves me money and most of all my precious time. It also offer promos, discounts, vouchers, and many other freebies which made this app really great. Thanks GCash.","1186":"the cash back is fake for your first payment of the bill using gcash app! i did not recieve any cash back. I paid our bill january 18(friday) and gcash care wont even bother to reply tho they have recieved the message! uninstall!","1195":"A great app for people on the go. I use this to pay my bills without the hassle, and also to buy load which is very helpful especially when Autoload service is not available where I am. The only issue is that sometimes it is difficult to cash-in on some OTCs and delays in topping up the account.","1916":"GCASH is good, but cannot keep the promises it makes. I have done a handful of their promos in the past and only one or two have actually given me any cashback. This is very handy and easy to use, but going to their Customer Service is something that would make you rethink if you actually need that $10 refunded. Globe really has one of the worst customer service, next to PLDT. Dropping names here coz wth, they really do suck.","2309":"Very convenient and useful! I like how it becomes very easy to cash in to my gcash account and buy my eload. Im very happy with this finance app! A quick suggestion hope you consider the following 1. can we have a separate pin\/pasword for transfer from bank? It will be great to have this option as this will further improve our security 2. To load up beep card.

I've lost my trust on this app. I invested a lot in this app though.","4289":"This makes transactions more convenient.. I had to able to reserve a movie ticket in advance without anymore lining up and pay online transactions fast. The gcash card was also delivered in about ten days..\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d The only cons here is that some shops that accepts gcash cash-in have poor connection and unable to process deposits...and you have to find globe stores just to cash in..but overall it is \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d","4605":"Decided to try this app to pay a bill since I heard is was convenient & easy to use. Made a transaction for my cable bill,the payment wld push thru but then the money bounced back into my wallet after a few seconds. Made a few more attempts but w\/ same results so I contacted Gcash CS via FB but got no help AT ALL. They didn't even try to figure out what happened\/recommend what I shld do next. Now I have a balance in my wallet that I cant do anything with. POOR POOR SERVICE!!!","5180":"Gcash is a great app, it makes transactions easier and a great way to start a cashless life since I'm very amazed with China's cashless society. My only complain is that it took long before Gcash approve the syncing of my master card to the app which I need to do some over haul.","5556":"Hassle-free payment and bank transfers. This is a great app to use especially if you don't want to spend time falling in long lines on banks\/payment centers to make transactions. Although, I had experienced a glitch during an attempt to send money and it took a while for the CSR to respond to my inquiry. Hopefully, this doesn't happen going forward.","5710":"Save Money feature is still not working despite updates. Promos are not even true I suppose.","5838":"Super convenient! I use it all the time for online purchases, bills payment and nowadays even instore purchases. I love how more and more stores accept it as payment option. No need to bring my wallet.

Oh and the convenience of receiving remmittance! Good job devs. just hope the security is super high too..","6035":"GCash has always been convenient to use. Love the rebates, and performing a cash in doesn't require an additional charge. Love it more now that it has a send money to bank feature. Hoping that it will always be free, or at a minimal charge at least. Good job! Keep improving, guys!

I entered the correct OTP and yet it says transaction failed :(","6149":"I wanted to verify my gcash through gmail. But the 6 digit verification code wouldn't go through. I resend my verification code but still, a message won't pop-up. Can you fix this?","6819":"Poor customer support.

Transferring cash and paying bills and merchants are just one click and scan away. So convenient and time saving. The app itself is very easy to navigate and it has all the necessary information I need on the screen. To spread the good news, I have been influencing my friends and family to use the app. I highly recommend this app.","7889":"Very poor customer support. I contacted them through email and my ticket was considered closed without verifying if my concern was resolved. I used Messenger for support at least thrice. I sent the requirements requested and not even a \"seen\" indicator. Regardless of the amount money in the wallet, users shouldn't be deprived of access to their own money.","8164":"I just updated my app about 10 minutes ago. My app won't work the app keeps on telling me that I am logged in to a different and keeps on signing me out after I enter my pin. Fix this and I'll change my rating again.

I already tried re-installing the app, I already tried signing out and logging back in but it just won't work.","8427":"i give 3 star only because this pass weeks i dont receive any rebates on buying load anymore..not unlike b4 i everytime receive 5% rebates..why does this happen?i used gcash to buy load for my customers..but i think there is no more point 2 use this apps. for buying load..if i gonna buy load 10 pesos or whatever amt..then they deducted my gcash wallet with the same amt.haha..so funny...","10460":"Since yesterday, I can't cash in. I tried multiple times, but to no avail. I received a text message indicating that I should message them through messenger. They only gave me suggestions that still did not fix the problem after I tried everything in that useless list. After that, they did not reply anymore. I also tried adding another Debit Card, but even the enrollment cannot be processed. Poor customer service and poor application. I would rate this No Star, if possible.","10541":"i wish the money you spent on marketing gcash be placed in your customer service.

I realized that, as with everything else in life, it seems to get worse before it gets better, Now, I use it to transact, save and invest as often as I can! and with the in-app risk assessment, i increased my credit score to the point that i'm now eligible for gcredit! great app, great service! i hope there's more investment market to choose from though, but otherwise, this is one convenient, easy and helpful app.","12464":"The best app for me thus I gave you 5. I used to pay our insurance policies thru Gcash and it really helps me gain more scores and now I have tried to apply with my Gcredit and in just 2 minutes it has been approved.

It's amazing how I can do all that and more for free! Thanks GCash!","13682":"Update... Finally, they solved my email problem. I have the worst Customer Service EVER, I applied for a GCASH Card, they mispelled my email address and as well as my real address, I keep calling and chatting they take 24-48 hours to reply back. I just want to change a single letter on that email address that they got wrong and still they can't change it. when I call their hotline, that idiot agent kept telling me to go to the APP to change when there is no option in change email address.","15803":"The full verification process sucks!!! I have to call the hotline three times to get nothing!! I have been waiting for the SMS confirmation forever and I can't resubmit full verification to accesa what I need to access because the status is still in progress. No one can even identify the problem and no one is able to give me a resolution. If I can give you worse than a negative rating, I would do that. By the way, your messenger folks, don't even know if they really exist, were UNRESPONSIVE!!!","16177":"I love all your features, so useful to all my needs, I can pay my bills, I can save, I can make investments, buy load, I can transfer from paypal to gcash to bank in just a seconds and many more.

So, I've been using GCash for almost a year now to pay bills, but this is the first time that I've had a problem with this app. I was paying my mobile's postpaid bill and the app incorrectly posted two payments on it. I called Customer Service immediately, and though they recognize that the app had mistakenly duplicated my transaction, to refund me, they said that they needed 1-2 months to process it. 1-2 months!! Just for using their services. You have been warned.","17024":"It has been a while! enjoying GCASH now","17082":"the app and service is worse now. customer service is terrible. chat service took a week to reply just to get a template response. phone service will take you half day and I need to take 5 globe #\/phones so you can get through because waiting on the line will take you 1hr and 1\/2 at least. for a simple refund will take you 2 months will require you to pass on hoops between their email support and phone support. supervisor knows nothing &cant provide reso. you cant cash in mobile banking.","17315":"So helpful I'm a student and this is app is very helpful to earn money, school fees are so expensive and without a job its really hard to survive. but with gcash, its easy to earn money especially when you are tempting to buy something but you can't because its in your account but one thing, the fully verified is so long process, I'm still in the semi verified so I can't withdraw in some malls and other places so I had to withdraw in pawnshops.","17571":"GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!! Concern: I have just processed a bank transfer to my security bank account ending in 2126 for the amouny of 2,000 but I was. not able to receive the money. I needed the money now.

SERVICE IS RIDICULOUS!!!!","18166":"This app sucks!","20032":"If you're thinking of downloading or using gcash, friendly warning DON'T!!! Better use PayMaya. They are hard to reach and in case of dispute they are not responsive. Asked me to wait for 15 days and after 15 days I was told that my ticket was closed without even resolving it. It's been over a month and still no progress. Update: a gcash personnel contacted me and helped me resolve the issue. Thank you!","22169":"I tried to borrow a load..and its showing that GOTSCOMBODD90 is available. when processing the request I got an error message saying that I am not yet eligible for it. Question is,how come it is showing on my app if I am not eligible for it. It is supposed to be greyed out. And also I noticed that my credit score decreases faster,from 403 it went down to 378 now. This is ridiculous.! I didnt owe anything and Im using it frequently so my credit score would go up high and not going down.!!!","22525":"Very Perfect and very reliable apps and hastle free. You can directly cash-in to your gcash wallet if you receive money from western union, moneygram and paypal without going anywhere. You can shop and buy online anywhere . This is the most useful, innovative, safe and reliable apps. Highly recommend this because gcash is available anywhere.","22633":"Code HJL3 error everytime I try to login using my 4-digit PIN. This started to happen right after I updated the app. What does that error code even mean? How am I supposed to know what to do if you give me an error code I don't understand? FYI, I already emailed you more than a month ago. Until now, the issue remains unsolved. I didn't receive any response at all! If you don't resolve this, I will just withdraw and stop my investment and never deal with you guys again. Very disappointing.","22858":"Update after 5 months(Jul 28) ; STILL DO NOT CREDITED THE GLOBE 999 LOAD I AVAILED LAST APRIL. Do not use this app. This is a scam. 1. It will steal money from your account. Unauthorized debit amounting to 4,500. 2. Fails to load Globe prepaid load. It debits money from GCASH but will NOT receive the prepaid load to the recipient number. Worth 999 Pesos. 3. Fails to transfer money to other banks(Metrobank) but again debits money from GCASH. Reported to Bangko Sentral, NTC, DTI to stop this app.","22912":"I installed this app for the link debit card feature and Invest Money. I applied for full verification and it said to wait for 30 mins to see the results but it actually took a few hours, but I didn't mind though. I also keep getting pop-ups about updating profile, which I did like a hundred times yet it's still not working. I cannot use the features because I cannot update my profile. I haven't been able to use this app since its installation 2 days ago. Worst app ever made.","23760":"The best mobile wallet in the Philippines! this app is such a blessing to me! keeps on innovating! I hope you add more products to invest in and add bitcoin!","24049":"Downloaded the latest Gcash app version, love the new look! love the color!","24077":"It took forever to get a reply from customer service which is really bad. also, the buy load system was broke around July... my 400 php hasn't been refunded until today. I have provided all evidence to get my money back but their response takes 3 weeks with no resolution. So far, gcash is a good app for online transaction. Customer service with delayed response and no resolution is just really bad.","24149":"1 star for this particular issue: Can't utilize the Gsave feature. Everytime I click it, a pop-up contains: \"update your user profile\" when I choose \"update now!\" it says Upgrade in process and show me the list of IDs.

I even have a gsave where I can save money and invest some of it. This apps helps me to save more a lot of my time since I'm a full time mom and busy doing everday household chores and at the same time taking of my only child. Thank you for making this kind of apps and hope you'll continue to develop it!","25935":"Your application does a lot of updates everytime. I understand the updates is for improvements but in cases of emergency that i needed your app, like to load my phone or even pay my bills, it is really annoying that every single thing on this application is not working when you do updates. I spend a lot of money putting on this application and all of a sudden it will not work without prior notice that you will have a maintenance or updates. There is so many due date i've never caught up. sucks!","27013":"There are a lot of buggy features. My worst experience with this app is the fact that I was already a fully verified member, yet GCash revoked that without explaining why and I have to verify again. I can't do this however because the app always says System error try again later whenever I try to fully verify. Now I'm stuck with the limits of a basic member. UPDATE: Over 2 months has passed now and still this issue hasn't been fixed. As a result, all the money that I invested here remains stuck.","27423":"App is great. I have been using it for a while but the recent update seems to be struggling when scanning QR codes. The previous version takes a very fast capture of the QR codes but not on this recent update. Although it still captures the code but needs to get the right amount of focus or distance. Sometimes, I need to go back, tap the pay QR option to redo it before it works. Hoping to improve the app for that section. New interface is clean and nice to the eyes. Cheers!","28500":"Super dependable app!! It offers convenient ways to make your everyday hustle easy peasy. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb Been using it for years and now, I never have to fall in line to pay my bills, I get to book movies on my phone, check out cinema schedules, send money to a friend or banks.

You can do so much with GCash and it's totally life changing. \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb","28789":"This app was working perfectly until it automatically updated to the Aug 9 version. I was a fully verified user enjoying deposits, gcredit, sending money - then I was downgraded to Basic user. The worse part of it is I can't fully verify - whenever I click the \"verify now\" button - it leads me to a dead end that says upgrade in progress. I called the hotline which is totally useless and told me to email gcash support (which can't solve the problem even though I attached a video of the problem).","29360":"Best app ever!!! This app is very efficient for me, Its allow me to transfer money to my bank account for free with 200 pesos cashback on first transaction. Very safe and satisfied to this app, It very convenient for my family, neighbor at friends to top up load on their mobile. And I can settle my utility bills on time because of this app. High five for discount voucher given by this app and cashless shopping.","29380":"GCash has been very useful to me. The convenience it offers is almost limitless. Bills payment, bank transfers and saving money is made faster and less of a burden at a minimum cost to none. Not to mention GCredit's advantage in times of need. I love the new GForest feature too! Aside from the environmental friendly transactions made through GCash, it also encourages us to go paperless, do more of it and embrace it. The app's UI\/UX gets a thumbs up too.","29443":"Very useful app. This app lets you pay bills w\/o the hassle of falling in line. Lets you buy load w\/o additional charge instead gives you discounts and rebates. Allows you to borrow load. Gives you a free online Amex card for online shopping. Gives rewards for inviting friends to use the app and most of all i love the the cashback offers. Giving you convinience of using the app and rewarding you at the same time what more can I ask for.","29755":"Gcash makes my life easier when setting down all my bills every month and purchasing stuffs on my favorite merchants. It's what every people would like to have since so many transactions you can have with just one click of your fingers. Plus, a lot of promos\/cashback to enjoy if you're actively following their activities. All in all, I love using this app and if ever I run out of memory space in my phone, SURELY this will be one of the apps that I'm going to stay.","29915":"It has been literally months when I tried verifying my account. And just last week I received a text message telling me that my account has been verified. But when I tried to check on the app, it still indicates that I am a basic user. And when I try to go through the verification process, it returns a system error. This happens for both semi and full verification. Also tried to clear cache\/storage and uninstalling the apps but still nothing changed. I can't trust this app. Now change my mind.","29948":"The new update sucks! It keeps logging me out cause apparently I've been using \"another device\"! Globe I only have one mobile phone for peets sake! I can't even transact! So what's the use of this app now?! I already uninstalled and re-installed the app a few times but it still doesn't work!","30125":"Terrible update. Cashing in and sending money to another bank gets peppered with error messages and is always unsuccessful. It seems like you want to keep the cash inside GCash.. you didn't even give me the update on the request for debit card I already paid for months ago. Why don't you test your app updates before you roll them out.","30204":"That is it, i've had it... I'm withdrawing everything on Save Money after it goes online again... 2 days now and I still can't access my CIMB bank account... Very unreliable... Same goes for the app overall... Very unreliable... Save yourself the headache and stay away from this app They add tons of new features, but can't implement them wisely and effeciently enough that it causes more problems","30250":"Their App always has a system error and the support will takes a month to resolve your issue. As of this time, I am still in the process of fixing their error. My interest charges are incurring as I cannot make a payment on their App because of that system error. I will be turning this not a friendly user App once my issue resolved. Period!!!","30636":"The app is laggy and full of bugs. It doesn't send code to your e-mail or mobile no. in one swoop. You have to resend it again. For a convenience app it is inconvenient being that it is too laggy. I've tried other names but they don't compare on how efficient they are compared to gcash. I'm fully verified but this app keeps asking me to complete my details and whenever I do, it resets and keep bugging me to update\/ fill in those info.I really wanted to use the app but with this I probably won't.","30759":"Everything is just fine in the first place, i eventually made my own account thru my phone number then actually had one, meanwhile after fulfilling all the requirements and got verified they ask me to verify my email address so i immediately check it and tried to verify it but i tried it in several times but i still dont get any mail thas has the vereification code on my email inbox pls fix this.!!","30867":"Gcash provides convenience, secured and hassle-free way of banking.

Customer service is really really poor. Edit: That is the exact same email ad that I have been using to contact customer support hence this review. I would have preferred to give them a call directly but reaching them is next to impossible. 20-30mins of wait time is ridiculous! Minus 2 more stars.","31264":"It doesn't work offline.. this means that you can not redeem ur rewards if you do not have either data or wifi.. *143# is not an option to redeem ur rewards.. most of the time i am in a remote area and no data or wifi available..

The pop up message of update personal profile is so annoying. The function does not work whenever you updates the info. It always shows that it was never updated. Also, in Get Verified function, when you click the 'Get fully verified' button, a system error was prompted. Also, the available balance are not updated and does not refreshed. There are so many bugs. Please fix immediately. Even I already updated to the newest version. Bugs are still persist.","31540":"UPDATE: Issue is still unresolved! Shoud just remove the investment feature. And now after the update I can't cash-in through bank partners. It took me 1 week to get my email verified. It just prompts an error everytime I tried.

It's frustrating","32910":"Upon registration, there's no prompt to fill up a registration form and to create an MPIN as well. I've already submitted a ticket to the support team, and they asked for details to verify my account, but how can they verify if there's not a single detail saved yet in my account? I've explained to them repeatedly through a series of emails but they don't seem to recognize what the real issue is.","33200":"Super convenient to use!

From paying bills, load and game credits purchases, grocery and shopping payment, bank savings via CIMB and financial backup via GCredit. Been using the app for almost a year now and no regrets. Real time advice if there's system upgrade and costumer service responds 24\/7. Kudos guys! Looking forward to more services and rewards. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf\u2728","35928":"The latest versions i downloaded seems to have issues especially when it comes to Gscore. For a period of 40 days, my Gscore dropped from 550 to 525 even if i made the ff transactions: Cash In: \u20b116,975 (13 transactions) Pay Bills: \u20b113,375.14 (5 transactions) Pay QR: \u20b11,571.3 (3 transactions) Pay Gcredit: \u20b11,458.68 (2 transactions) Buy Load: \u20b1280 (8 transactions) Save Money: \u20b1165 (3 transactions) Isn't it enough to at least maintain my Gscore rating? Had the worst experience with your CS Team.","35953":"It is so easy to use and so reliable in handling our money in which it gives assurance to its customers\/users that our money would not go the other way around just what happens in some other banks. And for that I would give 5 star and I am hoping for updates that will give incitives to us.","36346":"I was able to load it easily but I didn't know I should do account recovery before the app closed. Now I can't access the 750 pesos I loaded into it. I clicked 'forgot mpin and sent the temporary mpin but the system won't still open. Now I sent a 'ticket' and I don't even know if it was sent or not. After getting my money, I'm deleting this app. It's too much trouble to use.","36353":"I enter my mpin and it just keeps loading! Stop updating if it just stops it from working! Not mention that banner that keeps coming up, it's very annoying. How are we gonna trust this with our banking info if you cant even stop that banner from showing up every time i open my app--even when i dont have the app on my screen, really? Fix it!","36726":"I just uninstalled this app because I've been dealing this 'update your personal information' for weeks now and not a single chat support representative or back end support team has resolved it. I just wanted to input my email and birthdate successfully but an error message always prompt whenever I try to update it. I did all the things that they want me to do but it's not working. It's useless and I am so done with this app. Very disappointing. Never gonna use this app again.","36793":"GCash is by far the best, in my opinion, E-bank I know. It can be used by students, with verifications as easy than ever that just takes within 30 minutes! On top of that, you can easily withdraw cash as long as you have their GCash Mastercard or Cash-In through 7-Eleven or via Paypal with no extra charges! The only downside about the app is that it cannot be used efficiently if you don't have any load balance, even in your Globe Telecom SIM Card. Regardless, the app is easy to use!","36895":"Useless, I will not use it once I spend my balance. Having trouble with the verification process, they even let me send personal details through e-mail and just told me to update app. Transactions are not even updated, theres an option to send it to e-mail but again you cannot add it because of of the error. You cannot use other features too and everytime you asm for help they just say the same thing.","36949":"I am so disappointed with this app is this a scam? i can't open the app to buy load every attempt i make you keep sending me messages that i have enetered my MPiN several times it is because the 1 i expect to display is i can buy load but to no avail all the time. I am so irritated. When will you improve your services. I have deposited an amount so i can send load but still i can't do it, it's not working at all. What will you do now i will get back my money and uninstall your app it's useless.","37110":"Im really disappointed with this app. First of all I didnt received my withdrawal funds from my online broker through my gcash mastercard but it still didnt appear in my gcash balance, second I email your support and I still didn't got a response about my concern. Third I tried to uninstall it but now I cant log in. How can you fix this? Because my broker said that they already sent the money back to my gcash and gave me an ARN.","37407":"Been using it since 2017. A lot of changes made. Used to have rebates for bills payment, now it's gone so i stopped using paybills and just constantly using buyload. But they have limited rebates for load. It used to be 10% rebate, down to 5% and now it's only limited to P50\/month. Still ok tho for the convenience it gives for load purchases and bank transfers without additional charges (for now, idk if you'll remove that feature too) but i'll just make use of it as long as it's there.","37523":"Really Helpful and Awesome App! So far, my experience with this app has been tremendous. From investing, saving, buying load, online transactions, shopping, payments, and bank transfers, all has been super flawless. Also a great way to be one with the environment with their advocacy to plant trees through Gcash Forest. Yey! Great app!","38075":"Intermitent issue on gsave money features. Stealing money and consumes precious time. Pls dont download this app, or if you did. Never try to use save money features. This is not the first time it happened to me. Basically gcash will steal money from your account and never reflect or transfer on your savings. You need to go to their stores and consumes 2-3hrs and call the useless hotline. Before they resolve.","38503":"ZERO RATING!!! Unreliable and unstable app. When there's an issues, customer service support doesn't have resolution. They keep asking for info, and don't read email conversation thread. I don't recommend using this app, most especially GCredit at GSave features. After you pay GCredit, you can't use it for weeks. NO RESOLUTION AFTER 1 WEEK!!!! [GCash Help Center] Your ticket submission via GCash Help Center - (#7594849)","38701":"This is a great app. It has a user friendly interface. I have one suggestion though. Hopefully you can add a fingerprint login in the future. Thanks!","39106":"GCash Escalations the issue is still the same!!!! I have the v5.23 and I am still stuck at Application Submitted but it never asked me to put in the details or submit photos. All I am asking is for you guys to GET ME FULLY VERIFIED since I cannot do it from your app for some reason. I have submitted all the information you asked from me, all the screenshots yet nobody can help me. THIS IS SO DISAPPOINTING!!!! I am not a new user and I was fully verified until your \"update\" happened","39304":"I really like the service of g cash . I love to do transaction everyday. I always promote to my friends so that more easier for them i keep on advertising g cash to my friends and willing to help to get the apps.","40572":"After the newest update, I can no longer cash in with online banking. The page loads but nothing really happens. I am finding Gcash too unstable now and unreliable lately. Also, I have been using gcash to pay for almost all of my transactions for the past few months, ive seen how it affected my credit score as it has been going up like it should and i feel happy about it seeing my score is increasing,but just when I thought i am using it to my advantage, my score suddenly dropped??? Why?","40601":"In their ads, they claim \"experience the easiest way to transfer funds\" which is totally the opposite of what I am currently experiencing. I cannot withdraw money from any ATM and receive sms saying \"Sorry, you are not allowed to do this transaction.\" The bank transfer feature is unavailable for more than a week now. I have communicated the matter many times through chat and email but all they say is that it was already reported and put to record and that's all! INCONVENIENCE AT ITS FINEST!","40685":"This service should already be closed. The service always has issues. I do not get any peace of mind whenever I use the app. Every transaction I do here comes with a fear of something happening to my money. This is the third time that my money is stuck somewhere and is unusable. This deserves a negative score. DO NOT USE THIS APP IF YOUR MONEY IS IMPORTANT TO YOU.","40714":"Very useful for my bills payment... I recommend this app for those who wanted a hustle free transactions... Just a suggestion, I hope it is able to pay even bill is not yet due.","41356":"It's a fraud! Promos aren't working. I was able to verify my account, cash in thru my linked banks, then one day it is no lo longer working. Customer service is not even responsive. It's been a week and still haven't got any response from them. Inconvenience! I am not able to do my transactions and even missed my shopping discounts! It brought me stress instead. Stupid app. Always requires you to update, and when you do, it's too slow!","41596":"Thanks for prioritizing my concern. I got my money back last night. It was credited back on my gcash app. All good now. I will continue to use this app as I love it. It is very convenient. But pls let us know if you have recent or future maintenance so we would not push through with the transactions.","42453":"I've been using Gcash for more than a year. I have nothing against to say as I do not have any problem encounter to this app yet. Paying your bills is really a hassle free and I'm glad guys that you have already added the option to cash in via BPI Or online banking which brings convenience to me as I have no longer go to 7\/11 to cash-in. Keep it up! \u2665","42521":"I got reverted back to a basic user last Dec. 4 and until now I cant get fully verified again. The support is useless. When you talk to a CSR, they do not know what they are doing and the solutions they provide do not work. GCASH support is also unresponsive and also provides solutions that does not work. Now, I do not have access to my money under the Invest Money feature. Looks like a scam to me and I am reporting to BSP & NTC.","42839":"Globe mobile data strength is unreliable so you mustn't always rely on this app for payments at shops. Bring your cash or cards instead. Transaction fees are waived when transferring money to banks. But sometimes, the process takes days to complete. Maybe it depends on the bank but during those times, it would make you think it could've been better if you skipped GCash and transferred your money directly from one bank to the other (free for 1 day process).","43746":"The App is good so far, but the reason I gave 3 stars is because when I needed it the most thats the time I experienced some difficulties with using the App. I contacted your suppport about the pop-up error I was receiving whenever I tried to log in and was advised that you are having a system maintenace. I hope that next time, if you'll be having a system upgrade or maintenance in your end please kindly inform us a day before so we would know. If you truly care about your customers.","43956":"I'm frustrated because it prompts me to update and then when I already done the update I just can't open it anymore. So I uninstall and reinstall it again but its not downloading. Not doing anything. Its the first time that I have this issue with GCash. I'm dissapointed. I have reinstalled the app again and now it's giving me another problem my bank account is no longer link and when I try to add it, it won't let me. I can't even pay my bills now.","43997":"I am very disappointed on this app. My Gcredit was suspended because of my 'existing balances' even if I don't have. I settled my dues on time. They have poor support and ther customer services doesn't know how to solve the problem. Always asking me for my payment but cannot provide good service. I DON'T HAVE ANY BALANCES but my Gcredit is still suspended. I emailed but got no replies, only giving me ticket numbers. Tsk!","44457":"The app is unstable after the latest update. I could not manage my credit anymore. In as much as I want to pay my Gcredit in advance and on time like i did since the time i first used the app but unfortunately due to the latest upgrade I could not and it is so frustrating because I have done everything to have this problem fixed but no to avail. Their support group cannot do anything whether online or through email.","44592":"I can't even login to the app. I've been trying for maybe a couple of weeks now. Every time I try to login, it would ask me for an authentication code. I'd enter the correct code and this would pop up: \"We're sorry, it seems that we could not process your request at the moment. Please go to Help > Help Center for further assistance.\" The Help Center does not help at all. There's a similar problem posted there 4 months ago as of this review, and it looks like it still isn't fixed. Uninstalled.","44773":"Deserves 5 stars. Gcash is indeed very useful for me. Part of my daily routine. I can pay bills through this. And I really love how this apps transferring money bank to bank free of charge. Though others had bad comments on this apps. But for me, it is very useful specially when they have promos that I received discount vouchers. Thanks Gcash! Thumbs up!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f","45103":"it was a convenient app to use before but now it is a useless one just like their support, same copy paste troubleshooting steps but nothing gets resolved. They say my account was reverted as basic user but apps says otherwise. It has been weeks close to a month since I reported it but still can't use the features available for \"fully verified\" customers. Help support would even ask for the sensitive info via email when those were already supplied during the verification process within the app.","45418":"Working fine now. But G Forest is not consistent on giving energy even when i do exercise","46795":"Love this app!! Been using this for almost a year now and the app has been a part of my daily routine (paying bills, ipon challenge, gcredit, bank transfers etc) I just don't like when there are times that it takes a few moments before my transactions proceed but overall life is so much easier when im using this. Looking forward for more improvements.","46941":"Overall the app was great but the customer service is really slow. Imagine? my issue was solved after a month.","47116":"Please fix your Loading System! I had experience worst service from it few days ago and got me debited for loading a globe number but didn't receive the load that I bought. Luckily it had been returned already, but I'm relying this as my worst experience from your company. I'm an avid user of gcash, that's why PLEASE don't let this happen again because it would affect your customer satisfaction, or worst, delete your app.","47490":"Update: 1\/23\/2020 My account is blocked and I cannot access my fund and it's been more than 2 months now and still there is no resolution on my issue and I already requested for fund transfer to my other account and no action. Very bad service :( ----- it doesn't live up to its basic rule or logic and by the way poor customer service. updates: i have several number of ticket all are not progressing and i will probably just wait for another month to pass. :(","48720":"I used to be able to use the QR payment method but when I upgraded my phone it no longer works. Says that the QR string is unsupported! This is a real pain! When will you guys fix this issue and add more compatible devices. Update: They are pretty quick in responding with their canned message. However, before I even left a review I have contacted support via chat and had a ticket created but still no resolution.","48738":"This app is very convenient for paying online. I am impressed by their customer service as they'd answer and solve each of my complaints. Now I'm not scared if the system have failed to process something because it will be fixed through their customer service. I can say that they're really trying to improve as much as they can to avoid errors. I recommend this app because of its great service and it also has more connection than the other money-apps.","49268":"Transactions should have an ending balance. It is so confusing where the money come and goes. Also whenever I try to verify my account it doesn't send any code to my email. I waited for like 10 minutes. And there's none. There's a bug too that I cannot enter my email address whenever I want to have a request on my transactions for the whole month or even 7 days. I cannot enter my email address.","49369":"I love GCASH! Very helpful for your everyday living. Just want to give some few recommendation to help make your app more convenient and fun: Hope you would consider upgrading bills payment by using QR Strings; In case your guests ran out of load (out of nowhere, no wifi area), I wish we can use Facebook Messenger App to buy prepaid loads since their app have free features even though you don't have any load balance \u2013 preferably include your exclusive load promos. Thanks!","49538":"Gcash is good, but linking the MasterCard is a frustrating problem. It always have issues. I recently bought a card from its partner store (that card was for my friend to use), yet when my friend tried to link the MasterCard to her account it says that the card number is already linked to another account. That's so disappointing and frustrating. We didn't even get a refund from that store. What a bad experience. Another thing, its CUSTOMER SERVICE's replies are so late. This sucks.","49735":"There are lots of issues with the app. Also, reporting an issue is an issue. Submitting tickets will just result in an error message. Update: Going to live chat will not even help with your issues. They will just state that someone will reach out to you via email. Also, they ask for irrelevant data like 3 signatures on a paper. When you ask them them what it is for they do not even know what it is for except it is the process. It is like a bank asking for a signature. Paypal doesn't do this.","49977":"Convenient to use. I always used gcash to pay for my bills, send money, bank transfer and save to cimb. Their customer service now is very accommodating. My only complain is my gscore. Even though I always used it, i don't understand why it keeps decreasing. That's all. And hopefully next update you will add a feature like add money via credit card just like in Paymaya.","50037":"I installed gcash because it's supposed to offer convenience in paying bills, buying load, and sending money. I usually save my money in gsave then withdraw from there at the start of the month to pay bills, etc. However, today is the third time this year that I withdrew money from gsave but it wasn't credited to gcash. The customer service is often good and accomodating, but it's just hassle and troublesome to have to go through the entire process of reporting the issue.","50212":"Been to trying to verify my email but until now, no code is sent to my email. Checked spam also, but still no code. My email is working properly, as I use it on a daily basis for bank transactions. Update since 17 January. Until now, no code has been sent to my email address. Been trying to verify but up until now, no positive updates. This app still sucks. Will ask you to verify your account but won't send verification code? Paymaya's been easier to use for me.","50954":"I absolutely recommend this app. It has all the resources you need from savings, to credits to payments. But why 4 stars? Not 5? Because, not just GCash but everything needs to have improvements. I urge Gcash to improve more and especially to let the earlier features version back like the connection thru msgr. It is so convenient because you don't neet to have a data to use your gcash before but now, you can't easily access it on msgr because it will redirect you to the app itself. But, kudos!","51666":"On February 6, 2020 I spent a good amount of time to get fully verified and yet I can't cash-in from my BPI online account. It only says \"Oops. We're sorry, it seems that we could not process your Online cash in transaction at the moment. Please go to Help > Help Center for further assistance\". I followed the instruction, search for resolution and dead end, no resolution. You guys are genius. 4star only because you don't set proper expectation with your customer.","51889":"I lost all of my money during the process of transfering it to \"save money\" feature of this app, but instead of being saved it was lost and is nowhere to be found. Btw it says error at first when i tried to transfer the money then after that i came back to the main menu then i saw that my balance is empty so i check my account in \"save money\" and it was also empty, check my transaction history but there's nothing. Please fix this issue.","52021":"After the last update I cannot use it properly anymore. Whenever I'm trying to pay or purchase something it gets stuck on \"Oops! We're sorry! Please try again later.\" I've done it so many times, still like that. My internet connection is also stable. If the money I cashed in can't be used it will be wasted. Will change my review if this is resolved already.","52023":"Rating changed to 4 stars as the issue is fixed App says to update but will not update or open. Was working great, but now its useless. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling through app market, it did download and install but had the same you must update new version message. I downlaoded the latest version on my apple device and it worked flawlessly with the latest version. Just will not work on my Android phone or download from the google play store, Which is very odd.","52817":"Before I can top up using my BPI MasterCard (debit), but all of a sudden, the card info was removed from my account and can no longer add any BPI card\/s. One star for this 'cause it's very hassle on my part. I can't use it properly anymore. Thought gcash would be just like alipay (since they are your investor), turns out that other apps are better than yours.","53018":"Can not link my bank card. Reported it many times but still they have yet to resolve it. Tbey even elevated it to their so called SPECIALIST but to no avail. Dont know when they will resolve this issue. UPDATE: Their SPECIALIST still have not solve the linking of my LBP card. They told me to check w\/ my bank w\/c I already did before. My bank already allowed me for bank transfer.","53294":"i am 1000000% dissatisfied with this app and it's verification process. I get the same feedback when providing valid passport and information every time. 'Make sure the information is correct' and I do. Just rejection after rejection. I just want to use my paypal account on Lazada and catch some good deals. I am abroad. I even had to buy a pre-validated roaming sim. but still there is another blocker behind it.","53567":"This should have been 4 or 5 stars, but the app takes time to login after entering the PIN, and if your lucky to logged in, it becomes laggy and I doubt that users will have a comfortable time exploring the app. Plus the refer a friend takes 5 days or more(other apps almost instantly), I use Paymaya mainly and I can easily see the huge difference between the 2. You should really improve your app, for better user experience and convenience. What's even its use if I cant log in and is laggy.","53750":"I couldnt register at all. I've already entered correct answers on the security questions and yet, the system prompts an error, stating that one of my answers is incorrect when its not. THIS IS NOT A USER FRIENDLY APP. Yoy might wanna bring this matter to whoever designed the program. It is not properly programed. And this may cause more non promoters or may cause more disatisfied clients. I sincerely hope that someone would take actions. I've been a globe user and a fan since year 2001.","54262":"We are under quarantine, which means online transactions are essential. This app has proven to be useless at this time. How many times do you need me to enter my card details so I can register it? Every time I press an option in your app, all I get are a variety of error messages, either asking me to check my internet connection, register my bank card, etc. I can't even ask for help because your CS is down at this time. Fix your app and its multitude of bugs.","54370":"I never had an issue using the app so far when it comes to paying bills thru instapay. However, it's been two weeks now and still I am unable to register to Save Money. Everytime I try to open a Savings Account thru the app it gives me an error 'An error has occured. Please try again later' eventhough my account has been fully verified. Ive been searching for any resolution but to no avail.","54598":"Please fix this app. Can't use it to buy load. It said that you need internet connection to do this.. But I have 25mbps internet connection right now. So how come its still asking for connection.","54653":"There are so many features useful but very buggy!!!!! Multiple logins even you entered correct pin, it keeps on saying you've been logout because it is currently used by other device like what? Pay bills feature also! Was just about to confirm it since it's a saved biller but it keeps on saying 'Ooops! Pin is empty!'. What pin??? It does not even have a pin in the page I am currently in. Please fix your app. Test it before release. Quality is the key to make customers happy.","54840":"Not all of the time its working fine. There are some instances that cash in's do not reflect real-time. It requires so many updates.","54931":"DELIBERATELY bought a new sim card because GCash (in 2020!) can't help me with resetting the password on my other acct which was associated to my old phone number. And now, the App did not do anything other than crashing since yesterday RIGHT AFTER CASHING IN THRU MY BANK! Coincidence? You tell me. So... here I am, giving you this rating with a lengthy comment BECAUSE, the app would only launch if i am opening it via Google Play. Opening the App via my phone's menu screen does not work!!","55077":"As of April 5, it's been difficult to use, after entering the pin, it displays an error, even after repeated attempts and when you do succeed it keeps on exiting, even when you have data connection, getting every single transaction has been a frustration, it improved a bit, hope the problem is being fixed, coz you usually show a notice if maintenance is currently ongoing.","55196":"So far so good.. haven't encountered any serious problems when I use the app. My online transactions (fund transfer, loading, bills payment, shopping, etc.) are almost seamless. The app just constantly updates and there a few system errors but the team behind are always available to attend to queries. I hopt this won't change, instead, evolve more into a much better app. I also look forward to having a pc version. \ud83d\ude0a","55320":"Good and reliable 90% of the time. Errors and disconnections happen at least 1 out of 5 times I try to buy prepaid loads. Incentives for using gcash is minimal, so using gcash is just for the sake of cashless transactions. Can be use to also transfer money to multiple digital banks, and accounts such as paymaya, coins, cimb without transaction fee so it is quite convenient","56089":"Very helpful specially if you urgently need a load and none from your vicinity's selling, and for saving extra money since it also has a Mastercard that is accessible any time in case you need cash or do grocery ( just a swipe away) , as well as in paying bills like sending money through bank transfer was awesome. #AGreatHelpingHand","56468":"I have a problem with changing my registered e-mail address. Upon registration, I was not asked for an e-mail address but when I checked my data there was an e-mail address registered which is not mine. I tried changing it but to no avail. I tried contacting their customer service but until now the issue is not yet resolved, I already get tired doing some follow-ups and aswered repeated questions.It's really disappointing.-","57481":"this is a great app, less hassle no need to go to a store to load up: when you've got friends on gcash, just message them on Messenger to load you then pay them back when you received the load. i also love the Gforest, it great that this motivates you in helping the environment when using the app. I also love how its easy to Transfer funds from a linked account. \ud83d\udc4d Good job. I only have minor issues, sometimes the app does not display the selection of loads you want and logging in issues.","57590":"I can't open the app for the past 6 days. Keeps popping this error \"Oops! There seems to be a problem. Please try again later. (Code HJL3)\" . Please fix cause I need to do some important transactions. I'll increase my rating once you solve the problem. Sorry for my 1 star rating. This app is doing great until this error occurred.","58491":"This app had been conveniently helpful in paying my bills. Lately I have been having problems in paying bills as it appears that I have to confirm my email which I tried to check and verify my email a couple of times but there's no notification. I have also emailed regarding my request but I received no feedback. Please do address this concern ASAP.","58637":"Edit: Was able to log in after two hours. I received a maintenance notice after the review. Uninstalled and reinstalled app. Worked like magic. Previous: What a frustrating experience. You can't log in and enjoy the services without having to go through so many errors. Even when you reach out to the help desk, maintenance\/fix don't seem to come any sooner. If the common issues have been going on for weeks, I don't think I'd be able to use the app.","58972":"It is easy to use and convenient. I would've given this app 5 stars but lately, since the beginning of April 2020, I have a difficult time logging in. Every time I try to log in it displays \"There seems to have a problem\" or \"An error has occured\". I tried the tips given by the FAQs page but still it doesn't work. Please fix this.","58981":"Why is there an error in logging in my acc? I have important matters to do what the heck is this app doing? Please fix this as soon as possible I've been doing lots of things just to log in this acc, why is this happening, dont get me disappointed I have lots of friends, I RECOMMENDED THIS APP BUT WHAT THE HECK IS THIS ERROR DOING?, PLEASE FIX THIS! AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, I have important matters to do. I've been looking forward for this app but now it's breaking my heart. :(","59354":"I should give it 4 or 5 stars when this app is working fine but I will give this app 3 star due to unreliability. It always have issues. Most of the time it is offline if you wanted to cash out or always under maintenance. Just cash in through bank transfer and it went through but when I try to use my fund it was unavailable. Cannot even buy load or transfer back the funds to where it came from so I can use it. Now my fund was stuck in the app.","59575":"Last update sucks. I can't even access my account anymore. Very disappointing considering online payment is better during quarantine. Prepaid load, payment for deliveries and bills, or even just logging in to my account, all unavailable since the last update. Worse thing is I haven't received any notification that there's a system maintenance or anything. Tried to uninstall then install. Still the same.","60029":"Gcash is very convenient for me, useful app in the sense that I do not have to queue on payment centers... My only gripe is you can not monitor your monthly limit, gcash will only send you a msg that you have reached your monthly limit without even giving you when it will refresh... I hope to see that this feature will be included in the next app update... Then I will give it full 5 stars... UPDTE: Still no way to monitor your monthly limit in this app... What a shame. I downgrade the rating.","60545":"I was skeptical to use this app as I've heard issues about it but tried anyway. Today, I had experience it firsthand as I was trying to pay bills, it has an error message so I thought I would just try again later, but upon checking my balance was already deducted, I have't received an email or it is not seen in my transaction history.Whilst, I am very disappointed with the application.","60609":"Too much bug and always under maintenance! I tried reinstalling it but still doesn't work. It's been 4 days straight. I couldn't cash in on PayPal or transfer to my bank. Man fix this! We only have 2 schedule on going out this ECQ! I Sent an email and still no reply! This is becoming a pain in the ass. We're experiencing a pandemic but tge service is not stable and this is b#\u00a3\u00a3 $#!+!!!","60834":"This App always says Temporary unavailable when I try to sign in. It would be wonderful if it worked, I could only imagine how much easier life would be if it actually worked. Im just waiting for a competitor to come along and give them some competition. Then they will have no choice but to improve their service or be left in the dust. I also have been trying in vein to get verified so I can upgrade to the next level and transfer money between my bank but its impossible to do.","61135":"It is a nice and convenient app and i like it. But i hope that you will improve it better like for example the transaction history. It takes 24 hours to appear in the list for your latest transaction. And when you buy load for someone, the confirmation message after the transaction has completed has no details whom you bought the loads not like the older versions..","61417":"I've been using Gcash for quite some time. Using it to pay for my bills loading my prepaid phones and broadband and my colleagues' and family members' as well. I like the feature of it having a Gcredit wherein you can use it like a credit card although it is only a small amount (maybe because of the GCredit Score i have). All in all it is one of the few financial apps that I use often.","61646":"Latest update is full of bugs. Even log in attempts became a hit and miss, then buy load became \"temporarily unavailable\". Bank transfer was fine only on the first transaction. When I attempted another [right after the first], it became unavailable as well but buy load suddenly fixed itself. What's going on?","61735":"Registration and cashing in went smoothly, until I had to use the money I cashed in. It asked me for a valid ID, a photo of myself, and to fill out a form. In the first place, they should have asked for all that upon registration so the users can decide if they want to go through with registration or not. I do not like uploading personal info but because I had already cashed in, I had no choice but to do it so I can cash out my money. I felt scammed. They are not transparent. Uninstalling","62208":"This app always has surprises for you. Today my WU transfer got locked for no reason. All the other cash in methods won't work from abroad. The support ticket is left unattended for over a day. Thanks, gcash.","63368":"It's great when it works. Been talking to support via email, (the only way to contact anyone is via the app and email) all day. Doing everything they instruct me to do. All the way dow to reinstalling the app and I am still not able to load cash into this app. Very frustrating when during quarantine this is my only option to pay my bills.","63435":"How cool would it be to have a Gcash pay like samsung pay, google pay, apple pay.?hmmmm..just saying...tap my phone and I'm done paying...lots of updates from this app since I'm using it and its getting better hopefully more improvements in the future...gcash pay..haha...","63506":"Buggy, not user-friendly that's why I uninstalled. Tried to reinstall a few days later but required an MPIN and recovery questions which I don't recall setting up. Contacted customer support but they were not helpful. Waste of time going around in circles asking me to verify myself using FB, asking me my transaction history, balance, etc. I don't have FB, and duh. I haven't had the chance to really use the app, so I wouldn't know my GCash details. Besides, I have my personal details & SIM. DUH.","63760":"I hate how you keep on asking me to update my profile every minute. Can you please fix that? I can't process any transaction because it keeps on telling me to update when I already updated it. -update 05\/21\/2020- Almost a year later and the issue just got worse. A good app is not just about new features but how they are able to perform their basic functions. How you are able to lose registered emails from your portal and ask us to update details is beyond me. Not very helpful.","63868":"I'm so done with your app. I lost my data and all of my patience for nothing. It's a very buggy app that makes it so bad. Before I uninstall this app, I just want to say that change your app developer(s) or make some bug fixing. I can't take this anymore. Please Globe if you will make another app, hire some good one to manage it for the love of God. Thank you for wasting my data and time.","64195":"I hate your live chat in the help center. I queue for a long time but the app automatically logs you out if there's no activity. That's good and all, however I can't go back to the previous chat I've opened so I need to queue again for another chat? And in your help center you only have \"submit ticket.\" Why don't you have an option to choose if you still have an open chat (or ticket\/unsolved question)?","64240":"This app is full of issues. And customer service suck. It takes weeks to get back to you and it will verify info first. Who the hell takes weeks to reply just to verify info?!? This is the worst app ever. Plus payments or transfers get lost or unprocessed and they will not do anything about it until you check on it, and it's super hard to reach anyone.","64908":"GCash is convenient and you can surely do a lot of things. However, their system is unstable and often unavailable. They're a finance app and they should know better. They also have a terrible customer service so once you encounter an error (due to their instability), get ready for a cs nightmare. One ticket would get at least 2 months to resolve. How can you trust them if the service is crappy? I do not recommend GCash anymore.","64964":"The new update has seem to have fixed the issues regarding \"Pay Bills\" and logging in. It's also more stable. Thank you for that! However, I suggest that you guys should implement real-time transaction history. This is a very important feature when one wants to track where their money goes, as well as be alerted immediately of unauthorized transactions. Hope this suggestion pushes through!","65183":"Yes it's very convenience to do some transactions like buying load or paying bills. There are two things that kept me to give you higher rates. 1. Rebates of load is only 50 pesos a month it's not good for business 2. I have been trying to update my account to open gsave but the OTP you sent to my email are always not acceptable. Why? I love to do some online transaction but because of this I cancelled those. Please reply my review so you can enlighten me about this. It","65312":"First time user: General observation Too slow UI response. UI itself is all over the place. Since this app primarily function is to wire funds, best advice is to focus improving, real time transaction update (1-2 minutes delay is fine. But hours?, that's a big \"NO\") To the current app. dev. \"focus on the functions reliability, instead of focusing on adding more functions while previous functions sucks. We are talking about peoples hard earned money on this app, please make it more reliable.","65324":"Signing up is something I don't like with this app. I try to verify by following the step. The validation step are tedious and frustrating to follow especially the ID validation. I don't know but I try to validate it with my passport and when upon taking a picture it said \"snap a photo of your FRONT ID\". Clearly, I click on the passport opinion and yet it's still want a ID shot when I click on the passport. Need to fix that in the next update because it would give a hard time for the new comers.","65472":"Such a bad experience in using this App. First, before logging after encoding the 6 digits code there's always a pop up of \"Blah.. Please send ticket\". So, I Emailed it to their Customer Service. After few days, I try to log in again so it was successful but right away there's still a problem in verifying my account. I can't even see my balance. Everytime I try to verify my account there's always a pop up after loading \"Please check your internet connection and try again\". Though I'm using WIFI.","65602":"I love the app actually it is very useful. They just can't fix the problem immediately.","65706":"I am so satisfied with Gcash. I'm so glad I learned about it. Most merchants nowadays use gcash so it is convenient that I have it handy in my phone. I also shared it to my sister and she was so thankful because all her online transactions become so smooth. , Due of course you ecq we can't go out so we ordered some veggies and meat and we paid the merchant thru gcash! I am so glad we have this kind of app. Very useful. Thanks to the creator of this app. It really helps us in many ways.","65803":"It's unable to scan\/identify QR codes anymore every time I try to use it to pay I would get an error message (QR string not supported). I have uninstalled the app multiple times, I have logged out of my account, I even used a different phone thinking it was my phone but on the 2nd phone I used, I encountered the same error. also, you might want to activate fingerprint scanning, you're behind. Paymaya and coins.ph have fingerprint scanning activated already wherein you still require the pin","66117":"Giving it a 5 now since I can pay Meralco through Gcash. (I wasn't able in the past). I can also do other online transactions like buying load, bills payment, Shoppee and Lazada payments, and a lot more. Thanks!","66577":"Super convenient as a seller. There are times when it systems go down but the developers make sure to tell users two days in advance on what days\/time a fixing of issues will occur \u2014 which is super helpful. I don't understand how some people rated this less than 3 stars because honestly, if it weren't for GCash, I wouldn't have earned anything during quarantine \ud83e\udd27","69190":"It is a good way for online payments especially when your out of funds. Thanks for gcredit. The downside for me is the Gscore, despite that I'm on- time for my gcredit payment and using gcash always in a daily basis,my Gscore is going down rather than going up. I dont know how the heck they monitor it but Im sure if they only see my transaction history it is a plus.","69431":"It's useful but it's deceiving in some of its aspects. I was excited to use the app since I saw the GForest feature. I even encouraged some friends to use the app too for this feature alone. But since I joined, I haven't received any GForest credit for my transactions which I supposed to have as per the terms indicated in the app. I tried to chat and email but they would only say be patient. Nothing else. No updates or what.","69695":"I tried to get my accountfully fully verified, but the application where you need to have your IDs taken, the image is not clear as it appears. It seems that this app is choosy when it comes to the model of your smartphone or tablet. Also, it does not support with a lower version of Android (ver 4.x to 5.x) as it does not install. How can we use the full application if you cannot complete the verification because your gadget is not compatible with their system?","69808":"My friends use this app to transact the easiest way. Unfortunately, regardless of the troubleshooting I've done to get this app working by using cellular data it will never work. This app cannot be use \"On-the-go\" and it can only be accessible through Wi-Fi never would recommend using this app if you're the person who do multi-task.","70028":"After an email to customer support, finally had my account verified. Would have been nice if the app has instructions on emailing customer support to get verified, rather than creating a fake illusion that a request has been sent on clicking the button in the app. With that, 3 stars from 1 star. ----------------- No way to get fully-verified. My money is stuck in gcash for 5 months already. I could have give it 4-5 star if this important feature is fixed, but now it deserves a 1-star rating.","70221":"I hope you can adopt the barcode scanner from Paymaya to pay Meralco bills. Its a hassle to type that long meralco reference number","70263":"It's a good app for load and few transactions. I like it, BUT I have this issue about IDs. I don't have any ID but I have a voter's certification. When I registered as a voter, they weren't allowing ID printing of voter's ID anymore, so I only have certification now. I hope the app gets to consider such kind of ID because it is smh valid in my country (ph). It's really hard to get another ID today because of the quarantine.","70460":"UPDATE: It's pretty convenient, especially in times like these when you want to pay your bills during the outbreak I've experienced lesser errors than before. Also, my main issue that I ranted in my last review was resolved -- kudos to the team. What's bugging me right now is the authentication. Sometimes it keeps logging me out whenever I log in. Also the weird notification that displays Gcash is running. I don't see any reason why's showing that.","70739":"Good when its working. It is helpful and convenient to use and do your transaction, especially the fund transfer feature. However, there are times that you cash in money but will not reflect on gcash account. Or payment that will not go through but charged for it. And reaching out to customer service and the lenghty process is frustrating. But overall, this is still a good app to use.","70932":"DECORP bills payment is not updated. The input account number is asking for 15-18 digit number, while the bill only has 6 digits. That is why payment won't push through. I submitted a report ticket, but all they can send is a default reply message about troubleshooting (which I already tried many times) I sent them screenshots of the issue along with the description of the issue.","71019":"It's so difficult to verify! after I submitted my Passport the next step keeps on failing.... I need my CCash Account verified as soon as possible! I need this for my college, but the verification process keeps on failing even if I follow the steps precisely, the moment I blink my eyes during the face verification step it backs out and said it failed... I'm loosing patience with this process, I'm not gonna even suggest this app to my friends...","71365":"I always encounter login error even though I input my correct MPIN. I also answered the security questions and I'm sure that everything I answered is correct, but it keeps on telling me that I have incorrect answers and try again after 24 hours. I trusted this app but it seems like I don't have a choice but to accept the fact that my account's been locked. Disappointed.","71404":"I used to love this application with its free cash in\/cash out with my linked bank accounts but now they are asking for a 2.5% fee for every cash in with visa\/mastercard bank accounts. I think it would be better if they would have a fixed service fee like 10 or 20 Php for every transaction. A 2.5% fee is way too big especially in these times of crisis.","71410":"This app always needs to be updated whenever there is a new update out. It is such a hassle because I don't use it much but when I do, I have to waste my data for an update with minimal changes just so I can access my money in the app. Just let the app open without consistent updates for godsake.","71642":"So far,this is the best app. I highly recommend this and would give this a million star. But I wish there would be free access for buying load in gcash thru messenger so that it would be easy for us to avail load. Pleaaase\ud83e\udd7a","71662":"Used to be free. I use this to send money to my siblings and parents respective banks, pay for my electric and internet bills, etc. Now they charge a fee for cashing in! And over the counter cash in above 8000 is also charged! Ok. 1 star. 8k transactions per month only. You just lowered your customer experience score.","71814":"It's a great app, I use it all the time for my online purchases and loading needs, I'd like to get verified but I'm still 17 so I don't have any of the ID's needed for the process. Their customer service works astoundingly well, I had a failed load attempt and filed for a ticket, got the issue resolved in just 6 hours. Thank you for your great service!","71841":"P*t*ng*naaaaaa Ang hirap maverified. Regardless how many times I take a photo of my valid ids, still it says that the photos are unclear. The app's camera is supported by zoloz which I think has a very poor resolution. It cant even adjust the focus. GCASH!!!! PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. I CANT TRANSFER FUNDS DUE TO MY BASIC USER'S LIMITATIONS. I HAVE CASHED IN DAYS AGO THINKING I CAN PAY MY BILLS. PLS PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE VERIFICATION PROCESS - LIKE UPLOADING A PHOTO OF OUR ID's Damnit","72098":"Still not confident with the security for large transactions and I still won't turn this into my main bank account but It's perfect for small online transactions. AmericanExpress allows me to do online purchases, that require credit cards. I get to buy stuff on Google Play. Tip: just put the amount of money you're willing to loose and your life will be amazing.","72202":"I was a Gcash user for 5 years now. Last year i was disappointed about the rebate cap. Now the cash in was changed! Before cash in on bdo was in the app. Now, cashing in was on the app of the bank. In my case the bdo online app. How hassle was that?","72356":"It took me time to verify my email (all good na). But now I can't link my bank card. The other day I just need to verify the card but it keeps on saying that cookies should be allowed and it is! But still can't verify the card. Now I can't even add my Security Bank account! This is a real hassle and not a good experience. No response to the report that I even sent thru email!","72408":"The app has a lot of glitch! I have been trying to add my bank card but it keeps on showing me the same error message. When I have finally added my card after I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, I was able to use it for a week. But after a week, my bank card was removed again and is not showing from my Linked Accounts. I have already raised this concern several times but there was no resolution whatsoever from the developer! This is extremely disappointing!","72431":"The idea and purpose is great. But the app itself has a lot of bugs. Problems. From time to time it will just stop working even though it's updated. I decided to rate now because this is one of those times. The onlt difference is I have an emergency & i have no way to access my money. Which is not very promising. Sucks just like paypal.","72719":"I cashed in using my BPI acct but did not receive the funds. I submitted a ticket right away but the next day, the only response I got was \"we will forward this to our back-end support.\" I have an urgent need for the funds and all they had for me was the above stated response. This is people's money you're dealing with here, so please deal with issues with urgency. Poor customer service.","72737":"This app always says error error error. Seriously, what is the point of this app when it is extremely difficult to access? I tried using it on my other phone but same problem persist. It doesn't work well with data even if the connection is good. This is a consistent and persistent issue. I would have to try at least 50 times before I can successfully log in. But most of the time i can not log in no matter how many times I try. I have more than enough data and good connection but still error","72778":"Very convenient to use during quarantine period. I would just like to report an issue i had when paying BPI CREDIT CARD wherein i was unable to input my account number and the text box for it seems somewhat distorted. I already tried reinstalling it. Perhaps its a config issue with my phone which is HUAWEI NOVA 3. I tried using the functionality on my friend's phone which is a XIAOMI and it works just fine. I hope you can fix the issue so I wouldn't have to use a different app to pay my BPI.","72810":"I have an existing balance or amount on my account and I've never reached 30k for my monthly transaction. I had an issue stating that I have reached the max amount which is 200k I was given Instruction to un-install the app and update my frickin phone. Google play shows very.5.29 I was asked to go and check the vet.5.30 I did that.. now they want me to upgrade to frickin ver.5.30.2. Do you really have a proper fix for this","72847":"Convenient, easy to use and applicable to everything. No need to go to mall or bayad centers to pay bills, buy loads and transfer funds to bank. It's a great help to me esp during the time of lockdown. I think one of the disadvantage of this app is the 2% extra charge once you reach the 8k threshold monthly and the 50 rebate allowed per month. You can't cash in more than 8k in a month. I hope they can remove that stuff","72879":"-- but the provided camera was still blurry and you can't focus on the text\/ID pic. Kastress. My suggestion is you should let us have an option to import the copy of ID\/s from our phone gallery or let us use our phone camera instead. The confirmation email also takes forever. I wasted an hour capturing those IDs, yet the code remains in mystery. I'm still on the 'verification process' and it's really getting in to my nerve. Didn't have the chance to have a transaction on that app, sayang, bye.","72887":"Why does.my gcash accnt. Cant be fully verified ? I take a pic of my philhealth card but it always says that its not valid bec. Of the id pic ir the info. I repeat it many times but the result is always the same. And one more thing, in the choosing of valid id its supposed to be an optuon for more Id's but mine doesnt have that option , only the required id. Pls fix this gcash management.","72992":"Please find a way to make taking photos of student ID and other IDs easier. I keep encountering a problem with my verification due to \"unclear ID photo\" even when the photo I took is crystal clear. Also, it would be a lot easier if clients could just upload their ID photo. I hope you do something about this. I've had this gcash account for a year now and still I can't get verified.","73117":"Cash in via bank card is no longer available making Gcash a hassle to use. Hoping this suspension, like your app says, is only temporary. I could no longer use my security bank account to transfer and load my gcash. Created a Unionbank account but could not electronically transfer my funds there and get it to your app. I have to go through all these hoops again which i shouldn't have to. It's not convenient.","73150":"I was considering giving 5 stars because it is a good way to save my money. But my problem is the part where I \"Verify my Email\" because it takes about an hour or more before I can get the 6-digit code even though I have a good WiFi connection. It takes too long and it's a hassle because I can't access other features without verifying my email account. Please fix this. \ud83d\ude15 EDIT: It's solved now. But it took a long time so 4 stars.","73204":"The app is good but its really inconvenient and annoying to do verification process again when opening a savings account. I am already fully verified yet i need to do it again from the start. It's annoying bcuz I am a student and only have 1 valid ID that's allowed in the app, and my parents is the one keeping it. Bcuz for some reason, my student ID is not valid and accepted by the app.","73206":"Again thanks for this latest update. All are smooth and clean. Still except for your ISP that is still slow and super data eater. I have seen that our local coop are still not available in the app. Hope to see support from local coop.","73214":"I can't fully verify my account. I know I'm a student but there's no option \"See More Valid ID\" thing. I tried re-installing it and clearing data \/ cache but nothing worked. My payment's deadline is today and I can't even use GCash. Please fix this.","73381":"You have the wrong email address in your data about me. I have tried to change it to the correct one with no success. Every time you tell me that you have sent a verification number to the new address it doesn't appear in my g-mail. So I cannot write down the verification number and finish the editing. How can I correct the wrong email in your data?","73430":"I had good experience with Gcash before. But lately, it always has errors, can't process my PayPal cash ins and now, it can't even log me in. I'm not stupid. I made sure my connection is good and my pw has always been the same. I made all necessary troubleshooting steps and I even check help center. I contacted you guys per your sms advice but no one responded. I need to know that I can still trust this app, this company and that you can still provide the convenience that I once experienced.","73569":"I am editing my rate as of 07 17 2020 . Since the first issue was fixed and was able to use this app I am recommending it. But with the recent update I am leaving it. I understand fees but 2.58 % is too much. I always cash in a big amt and imagine 10000 , 258 is yours . Is it justifiable? I am leaving you even my savings and investment I will take it all back","73764":"I can't make my acct to get semi verified!! It sucks!! Its always displays to be get FULLY VERIFIED but is has less options!!! The semi verified option now doesn't exist!! Its not applicable to a students that has no primary Gov. ID it is not helpful today for us STUDENTS as there is a covid threat!! CAN I JUST MAKE MY ACCOUNT GET SEMI VERIFIED PLEASE!! IT REALLY HELP A LOT IF YOU DO !!!!!","73903":"Very very very bad experience. I have been trying to verify my email so that I can use the savings account feature. All Gcash needs to do is to send the 6-digit verification to my email which I need to input. Problem is that it takes 6-hours or more for the 6-digit code to reach my inbox. By that time, the gcash app is logged out and the code is invalid already. Useless app","73925":"From 5 stars, I'm changing my rating to Gcash with a 1 star. Yes, it's easy to use but recently, I'm hearing a lot of issues about cashing in, paying bills or transferring money. I didnt believe it at first until it happened to my sister and then to me. Then processing the refund of our money which didnt go through our billers is way too long. That's a messed up system. It's frustrating. Once I got my money back, I will certainly stop using Gcash. Im not allowing this to happen twice.","74103":"This app used to work when paying via barcode scanning at PureGold. Today I tried to use it again. There is NO WAY to enter the amount I need to pay BEFORE THE APP GENERATES THE BAR CODE. So when the cashier tried to scan the barcode from my phone, the payment process won't go through - obviously because no specific amount is included in the barcode generated. Your programmers are the most inept and STUPID! You keep updating the app to fix something then break another feature in the process!","74106":"Very slow transaction process when dealing with larger sums of money. I got a refund a few days ago and I tried to buy something cheap with it but a \"transaction declined\" prompt keeps appearing despite me having enough balance in my account to buy it! Even their customer service is unresponsive and only sends canned replies. Avoid using this as much as possible and choosr alternatives like Paymaya","75075":"LATEST COMMENT: The app is running well. However, still i am discouraged because LOAD REBATES aren't available for awhile. Plus, 2.58% surcharge when you cash in above the minimum limit (which 4000 above if i'm not mistaken) seems too much for us users. Hope you will fix this so that customers won't transfer to other financing app.","75544":"very accessable and easy to use , it helps me a lot when it comes of savings, and buying loads, payment an all \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0d","75699":"Since installation of this app, life just got a little bit easier! From paying bills, utilities and groceries, sending money, cashing in Online shopping wallets and all other transactions anywhere in the Philippines. Hope Globe expand it further and tighten its security. Aside from previous glitches and unavailability of this app, all is good. I don't really need to queue long lines for certain transactions anymore. I highly recommend this app for hassle free transactions for everybody!","75770":"From prepaid top up, to bills, savings and investments is excellent. Application is very easy to navigate, nice app interface, cool colors. Security is good as well as notifications. Except i have so much problem with gcash mastercard, how to fund in cash, link and unlink. Account balance. I experience non receipt transaction, called the hotline and they were very cooperative and tentatively listening, exchange several emails, follow up very well. Round of applase to customer hotline team.","77643":"The costumer service part is inconvenient. After you sign up all the things you answered there will also be asked by the support and then along the way as you type the details it will automatically logout even if you are not finish yet. Pls know that costumer service is very important. I hope you do something about it. It wastes a lot of time. I did it 4 times by the way but since it logs out automatically my concerns were not able to be addressed properly.","78321":"I just updated my app. And now it's telling me to update it again?! I've been using Gcash a lot to process my bills and some important transaction. I love Gcash, so kindly fix whatever technical issues you're having right now on the app. I've done trouble shooting and clearing my cache and cookies but still not working. \u2639\ufe0f It's disappointing","80533":"It not allowing me to update.. I already uninstall multiple app. I can't open the app anymore. Been trying to update for 3days already but still the same. My connection is stable and I have enough space in my phone. This is really frustrating I can't even use my money on my account.","81470":"The app is starting to be useless and problematic. Whenever I buy load, I can't receive it immediately and have to call the customer support to have my load\/money back, what's worse is that it happened twice, my latest issue of unrecieved load is still pending like no one acted on the problem. Now its affecting my work, so much delays.","84049":"I'm very disappointed during my live chat. It went off a lot of times saying I logged in on a diff. phone or something when I did not and no one else did. When I was about to continue and logged in my pin again the chat was gone. The agent was gone! I had to restart the process once again and it put me back in the queue of 200+. I'm so pissed that I was to throw the phone! Please please fix it! I chatted because I needed help not to get another problem!","86334":"Convenient but it bugs a lot and there have been previous cases of unrecognized transactions.","86494":"I've been trying to update for 3 days now. I don't know if it's because the signal is soooo slow or whatever reason you've got. It's annoying because my data will expire in 30 mins and I only got to use 300 +mb of my registered mobile data promo. I can't even update this app, i can't buy load and i am losing customers it's sooo frustrating.","87869":"It's the best and most convenient app i have. Paying my bills made it easier no need to go outside and wait on a long line. I can transfer to any bank bank, I can load my self anytime and no need for me to register it on a promo. GCredit is very useful in times of emergency when paying bills. That's why i really recommend this all to my friends and family. \ud83d\ude0a","90604":"Please don't make the update mandatory. Have an option to do it later. It's so hassle when you're at the cashier, open the app and it requires you to update it.","90654":"Changing my review from 4 stars to 2. In theory, should be a very convenient app to use. HOWEVER, there's too many bugs, errors and the update takes days and I can't access the app while it takes eons to update. Also, it lags too much or closes down randomly while in the middle of the transaction. What a waste.","91512":"I was not using this app before since I thought that it is only for Globe subscribers. Never thought that this is a very powerful app. I've been missing out for the last nth year of me using Smart services. Hope that the service will continue to improve for the coming years. Kudos to Globe for making this very powerful and useful app. How I wish I can give a rating of infinity. Thanks Globe. Happy user here of your app.","91636":"Service fee is quite high if I cash in 8,000php","91720":"Change from 4 to 1. The heck! After the latest updates, can't use the app with just free data unlike back then. Another, I always do transaction but the GScore wasn't even moving much not like before. Worse case, it always charge so high on transactions especially on the Mastercard. Lastly, it will force the user to update first instead of later, it's annoying when in rush or needed for emergency. It's getting worse and worse than its previous versions. Not gonna recommended for others.","91997":"Awesome!! ever since i made that request they immediately update their app. Now u can do almost everything with gcash!! Awesome! These are the guys that listen. It's like dota that became dota 2.","92154":"It is convenient - yes, until you need to update the app again. \ud83d\ude11 I can't even use the app when it is updating, so basically I have to wait even if I am in a hurry. So disappointing. Also, the update package is ridiculously big. Oww, the convenience fee, goodness me.","92550":"Not quite... Lost load of 10 pesos thou not that big but sayang... I hpe i can use the app even without data... Because this app is really big help for me specially tranfering cash and load August 26 2020 very disapointed another update you killing my phone space","96622":"At first I really love using gcash especially because I am selling load. But it started yesterday when somebody purchased 100-peso load, I got my notification indicating the success of purchasing the load. A couple of minutes later I received a message saying my transaction was a failure. Though the said amount was returned to my account, one cannot deny the fact that my customer got angry and I was forced to make a compensation. It happened not only once but thrice already.\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11","96730":"It would be better if this app can be accessed without the need for mobile data consumption and show all AVAILABLE promos to all mobile networks. Plus make it possible to re-use personal details in previously deleted gccash account. Like IDs, e-mail, name, etc.","96753":"I would like to recommend a \"SMS Verification code\". It allows to send sms to owner of GCash know if his\/her GCash is trying to login or transfer money. And it will login or transfer Money once the owner reply \"YES\". and also a recorded video of face of the applicant when they going to verified their account, So they can track easily the scammer.","97132":"It's a very convenient app to use. If you could only make more partner shops that accepts Gcash payments on the provinces. My greatest disappointment is Gcash Mastercard linking. More than a month after I received my Matercard, it is still unlinkable to my account and the Gcash customer service greatly sucks at their work, they keep on promising but not delivering, after giving me my 3rd complaint ticket for the same unresolved problem, now they are not answering or at least give some updates.","97361":"You've enabled biometric login but still requires OTP is such a waste. Why should I use biometric login if it requires OTP every login? MPIN is better because I just need to enter it rather than going through 2 step process for biometric login. Too much effort just to open the app.","97404":"The app is nice and convenient but i hope they can add these 2 critical\/important features; 1. Realtime update of the transaction history. Currently it's 24hrs delayed. Other apps have the realtime view. 2. It would ask for sms code to validate transaction. The code will be sent to your mobile # registered. This makes the app more secure.","97549":"Poor customer service for the app users especially to those who have loading business and bank transfer transactions like us and we use this app. Most of the times it says error logging in and will log out on its own. My customers in loading business is unsatisfied always with my service with them with this gcash. Always updating, error problems etc. IF this will not change for the better sooner I may change a for a more, useful and more productive app that will help me more in my business.","97552":"Great! My experience with this app is exceptionally fantastic. The functions that are added in this app are highly appreciated. One thing that bugs me is the constant maintenance but overall, it's amazing. Lastly, I extremely recommend that you should tap into blockchain. But of course, you must offer a lower transaction fee than *** app, even just a little lower you can snatch a bunch of cryptoholder if you do that. However, that's only a recommendation but please consider it. God Bless!","97611":"WARNING Your convenience inexchange for your security. After a while you will have unrecognized transactions and when you contact their customer service you will encounter one of the worst customer service. They suspended my account even though I explicitly said not to do so, and when they unsuspend it, I couldn't transactions to Google Play. Now they just kept pointing fingers and didn't do their jobs. Up to now I Still couldn't use my money. Not worth your security. DON'T TRUST THIS CASH GRAB.","97731":"Why is that there is no Student ID recommended for verification? What if the user was a student and he\/she doesn't have any valid ID's recommended for verification, how can he\/she verified his\/her account? This thing makes a difficulty to me because I'm still a student and I don't have any valid ID's recommended in the Gcash app. That's why I can't verified my Gcash account. I hope it might consider someday. It's just a suggestion. Thank you.","98664":"Case was closed because the agent PROCLAIMED that my issue is fixed. Summary: I cannot receive the verification code via email. Update: JAJA, for the 2nd time, you closed my case. Please, if you don't like your job, quit it. Nakakaistorbo ka lang sa mga client na kailangan talaga ng tulong. Someone deserves that job than you.","98899":"I have been a Gcash user for more than 2 years now. Last month, there was a need to reverify since it was mandated by BSP. The reverification is such a hassle because my ID is not a valid one according to the Gcash app. It took more than 10 days to complete (Sept 7) and now Gcash has sent me a message that I need to do it AGAIN?! I can understand that it is for security purposes because Gcash was used to give SAF but for someone who has done the verification multiple times, it is ridiculous!","98988":"Can you bring back the Student ID option for account verification? Alot of students need it more than ever since the academic year right now is online. Also can you fix the camera for account verification? I took so many clear photos of my passport and it still says that its unclear. Lastly fix the email verification code, I haven't received a code since I installed this app. I clicked on resend code dozens of times already. Thank you, I hope you would fix the issues i stated above.","100119":"Been using this app for years. I even rated it 5 stars 2 years ago. Every now and then, I needed to update to their newest version just to log in. But it's okay. It's convenient to everyone esp those doing businesses online. Easy transaction including bank transfers and paying bills. But the changes especially the charges for every transaction will have a big impact. We're doing small transactions here, and the added fee will be a big deal for us. Just saying.","101125":"Verifying my identity takes so much time and is quite confusing! They have not indicated what went wrong with the attachment sent for verification which in turn had me wondering what exactly needs to be sent. The list of recommended ID is very limited, you'd have to send them a message for assistance where all typea of IDs are listed. :(","101385":"Okay, i get that this app is really helpful, specially during this Pandemic. But the problem to this is having multiple Updates, a lot of updates on a month, even a week.. So the only thing that annoys me the most are these updates. Also, a lot of people don't have the neccessary Internet Connection to update app this every time.","101637":"It's a good app. It has a lot of useful features (buy load, gcash forest, transfer money, gsave) but there's a lot of bugs. Everytime I login, there's an error message and I have to keep trying a few times before I actually successfully login. Connection to unionbank is also unrealiable. There are times in the past few months, that my linked unionbank account shows an error but if I logout and then login again, the linked account works fine and then I can cash in. \ud83d\ude0a","102274":"My friends and I all keep having trouble when opening the app lately, as it always hangs on the opening screen before we are able to enter the PIN. We have to close and reopen the app multiple times and it is extremely frustrating. I thought it was just my new fone until it turned out the same on my old phone and the same with my friends and family who use it. What in the world is going on? All the aggravation and frustration can't be paid in money.","102492":"Useful app, if it works! Got logged out and now cannot log back in as no confirmation text message arrives! I have been unable to access for 3 weeks. Customer Services and live chat are useless. They just send basic 'uninstall and reinstall' guides and no real help. Also, expect to be inundated with spam messages about GCash Forest at all times of day and night. Stick with a real bank unless you wanna lose your cash.","102826":"I paid my bills and couldn't get the receipt because there is error. You should still be able to provide the receipt especially if you already reduced it from our account. You have our email, you can actually send it there automatically. Receipts are important. You should do something about it. Transaction history isn't enough for our customers. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e","102871":"This app is very useful. The user interface is also very easy to learn, although I think it could be improved aesthetically. One thing I don't love about it though is that it introduces several breaking changes from one update to the next, which means that if a new update is available, the app would be broken and I won't be able to use it even when I'm not ready to update yet. Even so, I'll give 5 stars because it definitely made my life kore convenient.","103253":"It's a useful app. But the system is also slow and keeps on having errors. You guys should make gcash faster and easier to access for the users because it involves personal financial information, but of course still make it hard to break or unhackable because of confidential infos. PS rebates in PayMaya is better tho, so another -1 star.","103303":"Best financial app for me. So far, I only had minimal issues with my GCash experience since I started using it on March this year. Just a suggestion though: please notify us via SMS when you have a service maintenance because you guys seldom do that. It's a bit inconvenient to open the app just to be surprised that there's a maintenance. Otherwise, keep up the good work!","103437":"Too bad customer service and the app has a lot of bugs. I has a double transaction on paying bills because I received an error when I submit the form and when I emailed your customer service to fix it, they keep on asking too much details that our conversation went back and forth and nothing was resolved.","103594":"2 things I am about to hate about this app. First,everytime I am about to log in,even if I was still not able to enter my MPIN,a pop-up message of error just suddenly appears and I find it very irritable.Why does a pop-up message of error appears when I did not still do anything with the app in the first place? Second,I never receive a reminder saying to pay my bills even if I already set a reminder for each of my bills. What's the point of having an option like that if it's not doing its work.","103624":"Be careful when paying bills with this app. Unlike bank mobile apps (I use 5 other bank apps), GCash does not indicate the fees in the confirmation page. It only has a generic statement saying that \"some billers may charge a transaction fee\". You will only see the fee deducted after clicking the \"CONFIRM\" button and the transaction is already done. Note that their website is not updated so you can't rely on it for transaction fees of billers. Just use your online bank app to pay your bills.","103654":"This is a great app. But I hope developer will add or change the feature involving receipt. Upon payment, you still need to hit the save button. Many forgot to do that. Receipt is very important during payment. I hope there is an auto-save feature whenever payment was made. Because the notification in email isn't enough for others, their still looking for reciept. TY","104086":"The app is good and i like it, what i dont like in this app is you cannot see the remaining limit of your transaction for the month, unlike paymaya, if you have 100k then you cash in 30k, there is an option in app that you are allowed to cash in 70k for the month, unlike in this app gcash you will need to compute it manually to know if your account is in the limit, like the help center said. Hoping to include this in your next update. Thank you","104696":"I have never experienced (yet) any kind of failed transaction. This is the best payment app for me because it is easy to use and you easily link your bank accounts too. What I don't like about this app is the logging in process. It's slow and sometimes you encounter an error everytime. I have to exit the app and reopen it. Hopefully it will be fixed.","104962":"This app helps me with ease in paying bills online and deposit cash in my bank account in the comfort of my home especially with our situation. But I didn't know that there's a limit in cashing in and I need to pay for a fee everytime I cash in because I already reached the limit. Anyway, hope our situation will be ok very soon. Thanks for your service! \u263a","105193":"I love this app because it's very convenient in transfering money but I hope student ID would be on the list of accepted Id's. This app would be very helpful, for us students, if it would accept our ID( student ID). Until now,I can't cashout the money my aunt sent to me because I thought they would accept it. I know it's also my fault.","105861":"This app, while useful, currently has security and privacy gaps that can cause issues on your phone. It asks for invasive permissons to be set and I found that allowing permissions on your camera\/recording hi-jacks your camera and audio functions. I had video and sound issues on my phone of this app. I also don't know if the app has been recording me since I have had it. So please be sure to set all its requested permissions to \"Deny\".","107330":"It was a great app until i encountered a few system errors and bugs. Also please include options for regular load whenever you update your app. Coz there's a time whenever i update my gcash that that option disappears and then appears again after some days. It was kind of an inconvenience in my part. Those were all my only issues but all in all it's a great app.","107782":"I was having an issue with verifying my account. Emailed the support team and they were very prompt to give assistance. My account's verified now, thanks for the service. I don't use other online mobile wallets, so I can't really compare user-interface, but it works well for me. Easy to use and I'm not experiencing lagging issues unlike the other reviews. I haven't tried using it to pay bills, but the rest of the features are great, had smooth transactions so far. Summing it up, thanks devs!","107804":"I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app after trying to log in multiple times. I still can't get into my account! Please provide solution to this. I keep getting the message \"Ooops, there seems to be a problem.\" I can't even access the help center! \ud83d\ude21 Pls do something!","108130":"Very disappointing app!!! It used to be a wonderful app until I encountered a lot of errors! First, I can't pay multiple merchants who are accepting Gcredit. 2nd, ordering a master card is so difficult, submitted my info 10x but I didn't received my mastercard until now. 3rd, now there is a convenience fee even if you will be transferring funds on the bank account that was associated in it.","108273":"I just wanna say your goama games. Yes its wonderful about the ranks but every time that i having a high score in the motorcycle thingy it always say \"automatically log out due to inactivity\" then my game and scores are gone! Its so annoying. All my hardwork in just one snap is all gone. Are you cheating?! When I got my high score it didn't say automatically chuchu and I played many games before I got it then now when I almost beating my high score its just say you're automatically log out?!","108612":"Very disappointed with the constant \"updates\" that made the app even less helpful than before. The cash in feature was removed which made the app less convenient. I have also experienced a failed payment transaction because there was an update while I was in the middle of my transaction. I mean, it wouldn't hurt to let people know when you will be conducting these updates, right? Now I have to contact your customer support and FYI, they suck at their jobs.","108865":"I used to love this app because it made banking a whole lot easier, but it's growing more and more inconvenient to use. First, I could not cash in money because the app only links with selected banks. Second, every transaction I do has convenience fees and there is a monthly limit of amount in transactions. Because of this, I have been advised to transfer to another app or open another bank account because it keeps \"eating\" the money I send. And lately, I cannot send money to any account. Ugh.","109205":"I really love GCash. Really true to the word \"Convinience\" specially when it comes to bills payment and purchasing using QR code. But I won't give it a 5 star until you fix the login issue that is, when I login and already put my code it will then log me out again and says I have been logged out. I have to go through login 3x before it let me do anything. Why is that happening? Device info: Huawei P20 Pro, android 10.","109439":"I totally get so frustrated and aggravated with the verification process. I've been submitting a valid ID and the system keeps on declining, what is wrong with your system!!!!!!!! You want a DSLR to take the photo of valid ID? I tried using other valid ID and you declined it still. Gosh!!!!! If only I can rate 0!","109466":"Poor customer service. I have verified my account and received confirmation. A few hours later I received another one saying it was declined. Then when I try it agaon it says \"Oops something went wrong.\" Very frustrating.","109936":"It WAS a great app. Transfer from one bank to another without any hassle and fees. Pandemic came when everyone needs to do their transactions cashless but then the associated fees came. What a waste. Used to love this app. Still a great app tho. Just doesn't suit small time users like me. It was a great experience. So long!","110235":"There were some instances that buying load does not proceed up to the end part(\"pay load\"), so I thought it was not successful. I repeated it, only to know that the first transaction was successful, and I ended up being charged the same load transaction twice. I raised it to the support (ticket#14565780) requesting for a reversal of the second charge, since this is a load promo (not regular load) but seems like she does get my point. I wish you could speak to a representative.","110285":"Good:Wired transfer from this app really helps people who can be able to comply for documents required by bank. This serves as an avenue for them to do their money transactions in easy way. Why 4 Star? Partners merchants are manipulating transaction can cater by :clique,kiosk(7\/11) in particular. Also, the new imposed Transaction Fees in money transfering and a limit of 8,000 in month? 8000 is only a small amount? Be reasonable on the Set Amount applicable for charging. Come to think of it.","110483":"It does the job. I can't install this on my Xiaomi Redmi 7a via Google Play. I had to resort in installing a third party app gallery and install Gcash from there. Everything else just works fine. I don't like it how it requires me to update the app and no option for a later update and it's a hassle when I am about to use it when paying. Also everytime I pay using GCash, the \"save image\" button doesn't work like it used to - I would use my phones screenshot instead.","110841":"Easy to use. Until it takes time to send code for cash ins specifically to bpi debit card users. Really becomes a hassles suddenly since you'll have to wait 30mins-1 hr for these codes to be sent. Its been happening for a while now and i am getting really agitated. Improve your service because you're giving us a hard time here specially if u need to send money and pay bills. And no, its not a signal issue its really on your system.","111074":"Not for urgent times. 1 time, I got locked out of my account claiming of pin expire.after resetting the pin, I still couldn't log in with the new pin I used. I feared Losing access to Gcash investment, savings and balance. I Had to Uninstall and reinstall the app to resolve this. Plus there is still the failure of bills getting received by the biller even after the balance got reduced. I only did it once and I don't plan to do it again. Support email only gave an automated reply no solution.","111582":"My account is already fully verified, after a couple of months, my fully verified account comes back to basic level. I cant even use it now that I need it. Why would I even need to verify my account again if no reason were provided on why does it came back to basic level. It is not as if my account will be fully verified after a minute, it takes 24 hours! It is very disappointing to not have access when I need it","112404":"Verification process needs improvement. It's very hard to get clear ID pictures with the app. I have been trying for 2 days already and still not successful.","112452":"I have been waiting for 48hours already just for the account to be verified but to no avail. I complied all the requirements that you requested. This is so frustrating and unacceptable.","112661":"Others having problem getting their account verified. It only took me minutes to complete everything including confirmation that my account is verified. Maybe around 45 minutes. I am not having issue with the app. Either those having issues are just incredibly stupid. Sometimes those stupid people complains whine about the app if they cant follow a simple instruction. So those who rate this app 1 or 2 star you are stupid.","112671":"Verification process needs improvement!! I'm doing everything I can to take a picture of my ID but when I took the shot it gets blurred every single time! It sucks!!","112750":"I've tried many times to login. I also uninstalled and reinstalled the app to make sure. BUT, it just keeps saying something went wrong please submit a ticket. WHICH I ALREADY HAVE MULTIPLE TIMES I was already able to login a few days ago, but for some reason it won't allow me now.","112816":"It's almost Christmas and this js so unacceptable! My money in there will be worthless if I'm not verified! I've been sending and following all the requirements for so many times! When I did it they'll tell me I need to send again and re-submit a new ticket number, and then I'll wait for days again! After that everything just repeats!!!","112880":"I've already sent my verification three times and each time gets rejected! This needs improvement, I need to get verified to cash out my money and I can't because of this verification process that took so long. This is frustrating!","113121":"No longer reliable. I have two bank transfers that has been delayed for days which is so inconvenient because it was for emergency. I had to borrow money from other people just because Gcash was unable to transfer the money on time!","113240":"It is indeed a well designed, easy to use app, but the system and people behind it is useless especially in the verification process. Only those ID thats in their list would be acknowledge and get verified faster , but for the other options like having a secondary ID is a total disappointment .","113291":"well I tried to open my credits but it won't load, i thought it was my internet connection but it seems that there was a glitch and when I came back to the back there are notice that they are fixing something. I hope you can fix this quickly because the app is really convenient.","113443":"Update 3yrs later (from a bad 1star review) .. Except for occasional downtimes, this is an indispensable tool for anything you'll ever need for digital payments, and much more. UI is pretty good. Works great for WFH people like me.","113833":"I cant verify my account. Everytime I'm pressing the \"Get Verified\" button, the dialog panel will pop up \"something went wrong\". Please fix this one. Another thing was I dont have any rebates from my load transactions started last week of November and untill now. This app lot of issues and it is annoying.","114022":"I will give you 1 star yet since I'm pissed with how slow this app becomes because of its new update. The earlier version is way much better than this new one. I hope you can do something about this as I cannot buy load since last night. Its getting into my nerve. I will be happy to give you star as much as you deserve after this problem is fix.","114541":"This is the best all in one application for convenience! Savings, load, credit, paying bills, insurance, and so much more are available in this application! It's definitely very helpful most especially during the pandemic and even before the pandemic. Despite some issues that occur at times, GCash still manages to resolve those issues quickly.","114751":"The app is really helpful for paying my bills and buying stuffs online. It's really convenient. My only issue is the fact that the virtual Amex card doesn't even work for online payments that requires a credit card since I only have a debit card. I don't know what the issue is and the FAQ on their website doesn't help me.","114839":"so far i found this very helpful, it's just a bit hassle when you cannot use the app until you update the it and we all knew that the internet at daytime is so lag and it was a struggle to update the app when you gonna have to use it. despite that, I'm grateful how convenient this app became specially these days that we should have lesser interactions with other people.","115902":"Cash in partners (convience stores and bayad centers) are always in offline mode. I once experienced that this app\/ewallet was offline when paying my groceries. good thing, I have extra cash at hand. What an embarrassing situation if I don't carry. For now, it is not a reliable solution to cashless transaction. Better to have other ewallet or cards. I now do not put all of my everyday funds in GCash. update: the over the counter cash in limit sucks big time. Better to use my debit cards.","116466":"I am disappointed in the verification process. I sent six times just to get my account verified using my student ID but it took me THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS to fix this. I do not understand why your company keep saying that I should need to RESUBMIT a TICKET even though I am sending the requirements you demanded on your customer RIGHTLY.I am expecting that the transaction will be quick but it took DELAYS. I am giving this one star only for the performance requires much improvement and I'm in a need","116740":"Regarding the promo, please bring back the rebate automatically. It is just a waste of time logging in and scratching the screen for a single peso rebate. We have lots of things do which is much more important than scratching the screen. Lets just use our time wisely.","117414":"Okay so far. Only problem I have is it doesnt show you your running balance after each transactions like what you get in banks like bdo, bpi and metrobank. It is hard to keep track of you're running balance after sending or receiving money. In this digital time where money exchange is so fast this feature is a must. I have already raised this to the customer support but with deaf ears. Receiving text update just ads work. Why not post the running balance in the transaction history?","117526":"Poor customer service, I was not able to receive my cash-in which was supposed to be a payment monthly dues, due to system failure. Now a couple of days later, no feedback from support. The inconvenience to follow up every day. The service the app offers does not serve its purpose. Now I'm planning to withdraw all my money from the app but afraid to do so because it might not reflect again.","117952":"After the Latest Update, I wasn't able to Log-In to my Account. I got to the process where I will receive an Authentication Code to my number but no matter how long I waited, I never received any. My Number is still active and it is the only number I had. There might be a bug in the system or due to the service but either please fix it and I'll give a better review. Thanks in Advance.","117962":"This December, this app has this promo where you put on the Reference Number in their site to get rewards such as Load cashbacks and QR vouchers. The first time I used it, they pretty much rewarded me ASAP. however, few days later, it took a lot of time and sometimes, they dont give it. They also dont really mention how much load cashback or QR voucher reward you have. I have 4 reference numbers that havent been rewarded. And around 7 havent been claimed.","118230":"Sincerely the lowest of the low. Do not use this app to save yourself of frustrations.","118297":"A great app, BUT Some functions are not working. Alot of times theres errors. Its always on loading screen, and if i wait? In the end, it wouldn't work. It's always on try again later. i have to keep retrying just so i could use this. I checked if it was my internet connection but nope, its not. For some reason it keeps saying \"Sorry, please try again later\", the latter isn't just occasionally. It frequently errors, its annoying. Pretty sure its not my internet connection. I hope they fix this.","118416":"Seriuosly,disappointed! Load2Win, frustrating! 3-5 days it will reflect on my account, this is what you guys always tells us after having the voucher obtained, but to my dismay, only few comes back to my account. Tried to get in touch with help center, i gave my number and full name as you guys requested, yet you are asking me screenshots for every transaction that i made. Come on guys, you have it in your system! Why dont check it?","118701":"I have used this app for a year. Pay all may bills with it. The fees are low or zero. I have needed a refund once before when I sent 5,000 to the wrong number, and that took a month to get back, but did get the charge refunded to my account. I think it is the main app in the Philippines with Payma 2nd like AliPay and WePay in China. It is really the future and I hope cellphone payments continues to expand as more people use it.","118953":"App is not reliable always offline when you are trying to cash in.. how can you keep using it if it's always not working... It's not hassle free it will give you headaches just to look where you could cash in...","119772":"Good for convient paying bills Bad for using gcredit they will rip u off never ever use gcredit at all it confused you a lot and they response only after a while","120025":"The idea behind this app is 5 stars but the execution is poor. The money I saved cannot be withdrawn as it is under maintenance. I also tried to unlink paypal from gcash but I can't find the option to do so. Their customer support is lazy and stupid. They couldn't help me and they simply referred me to paypal. I hope people boycott this garbage.","120041":"I used to love this app before because of it's smooth transaction. But now I'm starting to hate it because of it's delay processing especially when you need an OTP authentication to withdraw your money from gsavings. It tooks long enough before your receive the OTP and it's really hassle for those who are in a rush. And it also took you a minute before you can log in because of it's delay and error like \"check your internet connection\" though we have a strong internet connection. Please fix it!","120365":"Everything is fine, except my GCREDIT! I always pay 10 or 12 days before my due date,.... I never paid after my due date because I wanted my gscore to go up. I always use it for loading, accepting payment via money transfer, and etc. and yet they always deduct my gscore. Whenever I reached 520 gscore it will go down to 480, 460 and 420... Is this a big Joke?","120402":"The app is Good. It also has customer protection for unauthorized transaction, lost or stolen cards and the likes. However I personally had an experience with an unauthorize transaction since I lost my phone. Their representatives do not know how their terms work. I reported my case within 24 hrs. But that specific agent named Paolo did not understand and tagged my case solved. I recommend having competent agents that suits your business. Then I will rate this with 5 stars.","120609":"I haven't used Gcash for so long, I've started using it weeks ago, in my honest opinion about the app, is that the services given by gcash is good, easily accessible. I havent encountered pop-up ads. Cash in options and sending are manageable. Cash out options needs to be updated specially the map. But overall its good, just need bit of improvement. Lastly, the investment option, yeah still needs improvement.","120621":"Dude. For the love of God, it is taking too long to be installed. I uninstalled it cause it said there's an error and it suggested \"send a ticket\". When I clicked on it it's showing \"error\" What the actual ****. It's urgently needed and you're doing that! Your help center is useless! It says too many requests!","120674":"Even though I've been a long time Gcash user, I have to admit it has way more issues than Paymaya. Its always on service maintenance, transactions are slow, and customer service support is barely able to help. I made a purchase at Puregold and the transaction failed. The amount was already debited from my account but Puregold did not receive the payment and did not allow me to leave with my purchase. It's been 3 days and my account still hasn't been refunded. Beware of this app!","120953":"Always having trouble with purchasing game credits. The confirmation of the purchase is there, but no code. I was trying to purchase a game on steam that is on sale and didn't get my code. Contacted gcash through facebook, twitter and help center. My code was sent to me after 48 hours, and the game that I was trying to purchase is not on sale anymore. Never would have expected that it will take this long to resolve this issue.","121418":"Very convenient to use. Though there are some technical issues, but GCash Support is very accommodating and providing solutions to my concerns. I've been using GCash for more than 2years now, but I haven't loss any amount of money unexpectedly using this app. Plus, all my transactions are free! I hope this app will keep its services free and convenient. Thank you GCash!","121663":"i've tried many times to picture my ID to verified, but the Camera that they provide has low quality. that's why i was not able to send my picture for a very long period time... but other than that, this App is so good because for those having problem on Kwrta padala can be available to send here.","121875":"It is indeed helpful to pay bills or send E-loads but it errors all of the sudden. If I hadn't updated it, I might not be able to open and utilize it. There was no notification sent as well that it needs to be updated. It was a horrible experience as I badly need to pay that day. I ended up finding other means tho. Please do ways to improve your app.","122890":"The app makes paying bills etc convenient. However, it has been full of errors for the last few days - \"check internet connection\" and \"not available for Android 4.4 and bellow\" (even if the phone is Android 8.1). This kept happening when I was on PLDT Wifi. I tried using Globe data and it worked fine. Does this mean we can't use GCash anymore if we're using a non-Globe network? Tried this numerous times as of this writing. Works on Globe data, doesn't work on PLDT wifi. Please fix this.","123016":"Can't login. I always get the error message \"Oops! This feature does not support Android ver4.4 and lower\" even if the version I have on my phone is higher. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but I got the same error. I transferred my sim card to another phone, installed the app and tried to login... Same error message. It was working fine weeks ago. This is so frustrating..","123181":"Very rare to experience problems, as everything here works fine. Customer service does answer, sometimes late, sometimes early, in case I've encountered a problem.","123194":"This is the only app that i made sure that is always up to date but it gives me to much trouble everytime i used it. When paying bills, it sometimes show an error and look like that it is not being processed but in reality it is. Because of that i ended being charged multiple times and customer service cant do anything about it.","123362":"Overall, everything runs somewhat okay for me. One of my biggest problems with Gcash though is that the account name for sending money to a bank has a character limit, and the account name of one of the accounts I would have liked to send money to exceeds 30 characters. I wish you can rectify this. And also, sometimes I have just logged in to the app and suddenly the app logs me out and I have to log in again.","123575":"Why can't I log in??????? I've been trying since 2 in the afternoon! I have also updated it but nothing happened. It just 3keeps on asking for biometrics and MPIN. WHY IS IT LIKE THIS?!?!","123747":"Its very convenient making transaction by paying bill thru groceries, electric and water billing and easy deposit money thru banks that no need a rush out of time and other amnities that you don't needed to bring Cash.. Just only scan the QR code and wait for approval reciept...","123870":"Please bring back the automatic cashback when you buy load. The scratch things is awful, I didn't receive it even if I win a cashback for a week. Please notice me.","123957":"Installed and uninstalled over and over and it still won't allow me to key in my mobile number. Wasted a lot of time trying to use this app without success.","124274":"This used to be a GREAT app.. now, i'm experiencing a lot of hassles, just like the other users experienced... there are transaction limits that I have never experienced before, it's as if, i am a new user! Also, these past days, i'm receiving notifications late through text & e-mail... yay! Everytime you update, it keeps getting worse.. Hope this will not be the case.","124557":"It was fun and convenient then, but now i don't know what had happened, i was deducted twice of 50 where i dont have any transaction on it, and then was looking at the score from a 400 plus score now down to 330! They app says of your keep using it ur score will increase... one thing when u buy load, before you will have a rebate and now no more... Please look into these gcash team...","124738":"POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I have been patiently waiting for my account to be fully verified but your replies are always the same - telling me that I have to send requirements that I 100% gave you. I have a lot of attempts on the Help Center but it's always the same. Now, I cannot enjoy using your app because of limited access. What a total SCAM.","124875":"Your Gcash Support sucks. They're not helping us. Thus, issue cannot be resolved. I have this issue regarding my gcredit since January and it's now February but still unresolved. If there's only another network that we can use, I'll switch. However, I'm stuck in Globe because we do not have any choice. If you guys want your users to experience better service, then provide one.","125097":"So I just installed this app and the photo verification always gives me a \"blurry photo\" error. Been trying for the past 15 mins and now I've reached my verification limit (which is a bad feature as well). Can your team do something about to lighten the load on this feature? If you can, please add the option of having to pick a photo from the phone's gallery instead, after of course, taking a picture of the Valid ID. The one star is a pity point.","125542":"This app always crash. Like I am submitting my ticket manually, then the app is always slow. When I am attaching files and completing all of those, there is a warning saying that the size is too big. But I am just completing the requirements. I am hoping that the app will improve and avoid some troubles.","125594":"Yeah everyone should just stop using this app support is almost nonexistent plus they do maintenance almost on a weekly basis with their return schedule is delayed for a few hours after their expexted service return. Better of with mobile banking that has an actual bank you can complain to when you have issues. The app works fine when it does but at times when when you need it the most it fails. Good advertisment and partnered establishment is the only reason why people are drawn to this app.","126068":"The app works great if all you do is purchase balance and subscribe to prepaid plans but lately I find it difficult to verify the account via email. I have tried several times in several different occasions already but there is still an error message. It also appears like you can't use your outlook email to verify the account which is not a big deal.","126402":"Convenient app, good offers but the customer service will dissapoint you. If you have problems it always take them a day to respond and if you completed all of the requirements they requested they will not respond anymore or even give you updates. Oh and the app is also not student friendly, so if you don't have any Valid ID's for verification you can't expect to be able to use the app properly other than just buying load and credits.","127434":"Good app. Verification is hard tho especially for a student like me that needs this app to successfully save up for my academic needs. There is no student ID option anymore . One more thing, it fails on the face recognition. It always say that the photo is so blurry and the lighting is dark even if I'm already using a ringlight. One more thing, I can't change my acc name to my real name UNLESS i get fully verified which is a hassle.","128116":"Its good","128190":"I love this app but i need to suggest something...is it possible to send a confirmation message to the recepient everytime there will be a need to pay for a service in an app like eg. Monthly payment for the pdf reader because theres a possibility the recepient did no t used already the app but she do not know how to deactivate the said app...it s a waste of money...","128597":"I would have given a rating of 5 stars if not for one irritating feature. I've experienced twice already that I wasn't able to pay immediately because the app needs to be updated first! Considering our slow Internet, I was held waiting for the update to finish and just paid in cash because I was holding the line considerably longer. Please make your auto-update optional or send an alert during wee hours so we can update during free time.","129605":"The problem why it's 1 star is due to the problem of the authentication stage where in you need to input your number and wait for a 6 digit confirmation code. I kept on trying to resend new code but got the same results, I didn't recieve any (I kept on trying everyday). I tried all the steps the help center provided me but it didn't resolved any of my issues.","131233":"Getting help through live chat is okay. However, response from them would take 2 to an average of 5 minutes max. I wish we could see, or there's gonna be an indicator showing that they are typing or whatnot. And also, was about to leave a feedback to the chat support who assisted me but app would refresh itself. Was not done yet leaving a comment, then app refreshed for the SECOND TIME! End up not leaving a survey for her.","131337":"(02\/26\/2021): I think GCash received similar suggestions like mine. Now I can use my Postal ID for updating my profile to open a savings account. THANK YOU SO MUCH! (10\/31\/2020): Please allow other IDs that you recognize in the app. I only have a Postal ID and it's not available in the app. I had to fill up my details and send it in email to get fully verified. Now, I also want to open a savings account but I can't because I have to update my profile and needed an ID again. Thank you!","132202":"Not Satisfied, I raised a ticket regarding my limit to be upgraded to 500K since I have a linked bpi acct for a very long time and my acct is fully verified , I waited 7 days and nothing happens so i replied to the ticket and now it asked me to verify my acct again? It should have been asked in the first place and now I updated mybacct and need to wait another 7 days? What kind of service is that? If you want to kyc my acct. It should have asked in my first place","132580":"I rarely use Gcash, I only use it for payments. So it's kinda frustrating when you needed to use it (especially for emergency situations) but it tells you to update it first. I hope the user will have the option when to update it.","132796":"Ive installed and updated this app last feb18 and when i 1st tried paying it to the counter using the scanner it didnt get through. My friend who hasnt updated her gcash was able to pay for me but when she updated it on the spot to know whats wrong w\/ my gcash and tried paying me by scanning a qr from my phone then there was the error. There is something wrong with the recent update. Update: 3\/3\/21 Ive updated my gcash still the same problems occurs. Cant send payment through QR","133015":"Sometimes very disappointing because apps is ON\/OFF in playstore, Sometimes it appears and disappears we dont know why. Sometimes apps not compatible with the devices how could that be? Needs more improvements..attention developers.","133077":"Usually I don't have any issues with Gcash, however, when I cash in today my money that I transfer from my bank is not reflecting in my account. Editted: from 4 star to 5 star. It's credited in my account the same day I processed my transaction, It just got a quite time. The ticket seem not working, however, it's not what it seems. It might be quite frustrating but it was escalated later the day. Kudos to the associate handled my ticket.","133194":"i can't open the app, it always says \"something went wrong SUBMIT A TICKET\" or \"error code\" i always experience this everytime i open the app, i already submit multiple tickets but theres no happening, now i need to wait for a whole day sometimes the next day just to check if it's ok already","133397":"This apps is terrible During lockdown last yr. I used my credit limit of 1k so when the lockdown implemented and all the shops are closed so I will not able to pay my bill on time. So I send an email to them about what happen and I'm shick bec. my outstanding bill that previously is 800+ something become 2k+ bec. of the % But there is no available shop or bank that is open during the lockdown period. But it seems they dont bother. so I pay for it.Now I wanted to used but always error!!Poor!","133431":"I don't understand why until today, it is still showing \"upgrade in progress\" status. I uninstall it and re-install the app but the same error was encountered. I can't verify my gcash. I enrolled to gcash since last year but until now, it was not yet verified. Very frustrating because I can only buy load and make a payent via QR code, that's it. Can you fix this up so that I can give you a good rate?","133658":"What's with globe apps?!?! I always get an error for every thing I do on this app-even just opening the app itself!! It also takes so much time for it to load. So frustrating. Please fix it immediately coz it's a hassle that you need to close and reopen the app for it to work. You always require update it but it just gets worse everytime.","133721":"This app is stupid, always says something went wrong when I used the Paybills option. The worst thing is you can't ask this problem because in frequently asked question this issue is not listed yet, very stupid app, This guys are always playing money using public fund. That's a business strategy, we can't process the transation at the moment because they are using our money in different investment. We cash-in real money and that's converted to virtual money. They are using accumulated money.","133725":"It took 1 month to get a refund from a wrong charge because of a system error. While I'm still disappointed it took this long, Gcash does offer the most variety of services that rivals all mobile wallets. I've decided to continue using gcash, but I'll definitely stop using it for external purchases now.","134206":"If you want to loose your money, this app is clearly for you. After depositing any amount you like, they have the power to deactivate your account by submitting a report that you are not the owner of the registered SIM. OTP codes are worthless, even if you can receive the OTP codes for validation, once they block you for no good reason, your money is gone for good. Good luck in having a good conversation with their customer support! They are well trained in keeping you on a loop. Good jobGCrash","134390":"i didn't like the fact that it doesn't instantly recognize my id. i had to take a couple hundred of photos just for it to confirm. I'm not even exagerating. the id recognition is terrible. all of them are clear but still said it wasn't recognized. but past all those annoying works, it's a good app. still giving them 1 star though coz it's annoying.","134676":"It takes too long to open the app. Sometimes it crashes or experience lag. And I also hate that you have no choice but to fully verify your account. And they chose this time of pandemic to do that where it's hard and dangerous to go out and get valid ID's. And if you have one, you have to try hundred times for them to accept your ID. Please bring back semi verification of accounts.","134723":"One of the worst app to use. Not reliable and crashes almost everytime even though you have a strong internet connection. Tried to to do all TS but still not working so well. Always stuck at \"processing\" and will always load so slow. Updates do nothing, they\"re making the apps slower.","134985":"in cases that you have issues with auto payment, they just couldnt help. The payment history does not specify the merchant \/apps that you have made a payment with. it is frustrating getting an unexpected draft yet you can't track to whom did the money just go.\ud83d\ude11 aftervi transfer my WPS Subscription to another app, im gonna delete this app.","135786":"I don't even know why this has a 4.4 rating. Paypal has always been the app of my choice when it comes to payment but I've been forced to use Gcash\/Paymaya recently. Those apps are unecessarily stricter than Paypal. I have no choice but to \"upgrade\" and \"verify\" my account and for some weird reason whenever I do try to upgrade, it is always \"in progress.\" I have never had a productive transaction with these two apps.","135788":"Changed my rating due to a recent experience. Despite what others have been commenting about the customer service, I have had a different experience. My problem was resolved as fast as possible and the staff that I got the chance to talk was very accomodating. It was taken in to action immediately and they updated me regarding the status of my ticket regularly until it was resolved. But still there's still room for improvement, specially with the system of the app itself. Anyway, kudos to the CS","136113":"The app is good and very convenient to use but the only problem is since the day I downloaded the app I am still a basic user. I have asked for account verification using my valid ID and selfie and had filled out the required informations but up until now it says \" upgrade on progress!\". It already months since then I cannot access other features of the app.","136853":"When I downloaded this app and try to log in, it kept on saying something went wrong and I submitted a ticket but still it does not work. It happens every time I try to log in or register so I had to uninstall it because it's not functional and it wasn't able to give good impression. The worst app since the start, I would say.","136884":"This app is amazing in terms of services they can provide! But when it comes to customer service, it sucks! They will waste your time and make you submit tickets many times for you to fully verify your account especially students because they only have school ID, and will always tell you that there is a problem with your information and pictures when there is none! They said they will accept 2019-2020 RF but they won't. Hello? It's pandemic. No consideration and understanding at all.","136942":"I am starting to consider other apps with similar feature. This app is no longer convenient as it was.","136979":"It's been already over 24 hours yet still my money has not appeared in my account neither in my transaction history. Good thing I have the receipts. So, much for the instantaneous updating... real time marketing BS. I just want my money back. You have just lost a client and perhaps many more.","137055":"Why I didn't see the v.5.39?","137587":"In the verification process, the capturing of ID was very irritating. The picture I took was clear and readable yet the system always says that the picture was unclear. I've already tried a dozens of times yet it says that the picture was unclear. Poor system.","137601":"Please send us a notification if there's a maintenance. Its a bad experience for us who's going to register a load because of the expiration of our load. Hope you do something about this issue!!!","137695":"Alert! Never use this app, especially their GCredit they have the most incompetent support.. I've been contacting them both chat and email but not getting any fix on my query! They took my money !!!!!","137951":"Its convenient in emergency but sometimes you cant open it like what no update or notification if it is on maintinance. I hope next time give us a warning before it happen cause sometimes the transaction is important too","138249":"This is the best app for me. Real time crediting. Amazing features, I like the 'send with a clip' wherein you can send hugot cards or funny messages along with sending money- so creative. GSave lets you earn more than 10x per annum thru CIMB compared to regular savings. It also has a GForest wherein they will plant real tree if you grow a tree in the app. Very useful and convenient.","138449":"I cashed in with our PNB account but it didn't register on my Gcash account. It deducted from our bank account and we received a confirmation message from the bank that the transaction was successful. But I didn't receive a text from gcash. I've sent a ticket just recently and I hope I get answered soon. -Update: I'm changing it to 5 stars because the Support team attended to my ticket on the same day. I have to commend that. And also because the range of services they offer is good.","138561":"Finally the update is out!! I don't have to worry about my GCredit anymore, so I'm a happy camper.","140960":"I have Coins.ph, Paypal, Paymaya, etc. (name it I have it) but GCash is the one I use the most. I use it for hassle-free transactions across multiple banks, even with Shopee purchases. The multi-loading feature is also very convenient and GSave is also nice. I had a problem with a Cignal prepaid load and customer support sent the missing pin. Only snag is when I had to use it and it's down for maintenance, though that only happens rarely. Just be vigilant in protecting your pin.","141848":"I got the message to update the app and Gcredit on March 26 onwards but the app is still not available for update on Playstore. I checked the link again and it says in order to avail and agree to the new GcreditxCIMBank terms and conditions the app version should be 35.9, mine is still 35.8 because the team has yet to allow gcash to be updated. What if it gets updated after April 26? Please fix, Thank You! Edit: was able to update the app already but my limit didn't go up","142023":"Easiest way for transaction. Transfer money, buy load, pay loan and many more. as of now didn't have any problem using this app. Once I transfer money and i didn't save the receipt and didn't receive the text confirmation also. but its nice that you can request the history transaction of the exact date you transact via email. thumbs up! \ud83d\udc4d","142092":"Why does it take so long to get verified?? It shows \"upgrade in progress\" for months now and it's really disappointing. Update: (from 1 star to 3) Good. I am verified now (since last year). Please keep on improving and providing fundamental access on funds and money transfers. Your app is one of the most essential nowadays due to this pandemic. Thank you Gcash.","143602":"This is a good app if it weren't for the fact that it needed to be update every now and then... you'll going to lose costumers with updates...I for one don't buy the latest phone in the market so if you match this app with the latest tech I won't be able to use this anymore...you don't even allow us to open our account on laptop.","143679":"The best and awesome! It really made feel good and satisfied. Whenever i wanted to transfer money this app will cater immediately to feel you more convenient. There is no doubt that this app will promoted to my friends and relatives and families for i like it so much. It really make me feel good and satisfied. May this application will last long its services to the people not only today but for the rest of the days. It is very commendably important to commend this application to all the people..","144659":"poor customer service ever!!!if there is a negative star, i'll give it to this app. I was debited twice both in my gcash and gcredit way back 10\/13\/2020. Until now, the issue still unresolved.I filed a dispute to EVER supermarket and they took my receipt and told me that they already sent email to gcash and the pending is no longer on their end.Upon emailing gcash and asked for update, they will give you a step1 process which is to go back to the merchant involved.ticket# always changed.scam app","145130":"Poor customer service. they always have maintenance but they always failed to notify their customers in advance. I hope you're aware that we are trusting you with our funds and we used your service in our bills payment. Please understand, we are avoiding penalties, fix your issues immediately!!","146023":"I had no problems with my money so far. The only thing that's quite annoying is when i have no choice but to update the app when it tells me so. I hope there is a button to just update it later to our most convenient time rather update it first before i can use it, since it's a hassle especially when i needed it the most. Hope for your immediate and favorable response. Thanks! Edit: I hope you are also responsive in answering queries here. \ud83d\ude23","146296":"very useful for me. it\"s easy to pay bill's, to load and send money.. even I buy medicine,grocery.. for someone like me. because my husband is cancer patient.. very easy to receive money from my family ..when we stay in hospital.

I had to scan my i.d. repeatedly for 2 days already, and even if the shot is very clear and sharp the app always rejects and says retry. I can't send money because I still need to verify, imo this feature should already be included in basic. Please look into this. (3\/29\/21) . Still can't get verified (4\/14\/21)","147629":"Very disappointed with this app. Purchased Razer Pins last night and until now I haven't receive my E-PINS. Although, I have received an SMS notification that the transaction went through successfully. Already contacted customer support and submitted the information that was asked and until now there's no update. This is a real time transaction and it involves money so I think your response\/action should be real time as well. What's worse is your ticket number status does not show on the app.","147717":"As a part of the overall suggestion to improve the app, kindly check the \"stc pay\" app from saudi arabia. Everything's good in the stc pay app, very easy to top-up the digital wallet (so many ways) and very easy to pay the bills and withdraw the money (location finder for merchants and partners really helps). So easy to even cash out on any atm around the kingdom. Hope gcash team would put a great effort to at least gather the best ideas from stc pay.","147921":"I do like this app but the problem is that it took me a long time to get my account verified and so it took me such a long time to figure out how but when I finally found out how, suddenly they asked for my number because of the 90-day authorization but when I typed my number in, after SEVERAL DAYS OF Trying, THEY WON'T SEND ME THE OTP CODE so I got locked out of my own account.","148891":"This app is HORRIBLE. It's been almost a month since I registered and I still can't fully verify it! I sent my complaint through email TWO TIMES already and whenever they deal with my problem, they just ask my ID and info, then tell me to verify my account normally at the app again. BUT I CAN'T. THE APP WON'T LET ME VERIFY AND IT KEEPS SAYING ON TOP \"UPGRADE IN PROGRESS\". IT HAS BEEN A MONTH. GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY YOU SCAMMERS. Also yes, the hotline does not work as well.","149048":"I like the app very much. But this updates is irritating. Like today some of my friends are able to send out but I can't and it's giving me an error to wait for an sms in 72 hours and also sending money from banks like bpi or union bank it was successful already I have proof that it was sent but when you check on gcash the money is not there this happen to me twice, today is the 2nd time. The app is very convenient but your update sucks this will leave a bad review on the app.","149405":"I'm disappointed there is always problem on this app and they say you could get 5 percent rebate if you buy load but in reality it's just an advertisement. And when the app made a problem they just get your money and the robot will just keep messaging you. I've been with g cash for four years now I like it first but as time goes by it's becoming trash. I hate it. If possible I rate it zero.","149830":"The app is frustrating when it comes to the verification process, especially if you're a student. It will take you weeks or months, even if you use clear pictures and accurate information. I just wanted to get verified. I wish they'll make it easier for students to get verified. \u2639\ufe0f","150115":"I have created multiple tickets but you were unable to assist and resolve the issue. During this pandemic, you should have the sense of urgency and provide prompt resolution to your customers\/users. The money was stuck in your app, money that we could have used to buy food and basic necessities. You kept referring me to your Help Center articles. I used to like this app and even gave you a 5-star before.","150343":"No more load rebates \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e, my card expires in no time even if the card expires at 2022, machine wont accept anymore transactions and get stacked and no ways to be returned to you because of no name issue and unless you buy a new one \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e \ud83d\udc4e.. Very bad \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79","150561":"What I don't like about this app is the 2% charge after depositing more than 8000 a month through their kiosk. It is WAY TOO big for a service charge. The service charge should be flat rate not to be computed on the amount deposited and it seems like a hidden charge because it is not being announced anywhere, you will just get a shock of your life after you have cashed in. When you think it is the most convenient way to pay your bills by just cashing in the amount to your gcash,it is not!","150563":"It's so hard to buy a load and make any bank transfer transaction. It will always have an error even though the mobile number, account name, and account number are written correctly. This is so much of a hassle than convinience. And please, learn how to have a sense of urgency when it comes to sending tickets. Your app never gave me a smooth transaction.","150986":"support took 2 weeks for a reply for my ticket to get a response, the help center feels like a bot and doesnt listen to you. super unprofessional and buggy app that will make your account balance goes missing for no reason. dont use this app, if you want your money to be missing this is the right app for you but if you value your savings go somewhere else, avoid this scam app.","151143":"I can't submit a ticket. Every time I press submit, the form just resets. I have tried it around 10 times, and still the same scenario. I just need customer service to get verified. How am i gonna get help if i cant submit a ticket to their customer service team?","151188":"This app is very very helful specially now that we can't go out from our home.. But the only problem is nobody will pick up the phone whenever we call their hotline . I have unathorize transactions deducted from my account, aside from the fact that they don't have 24 hour customer service, nobody will pick up the call whenever we call their hotline. Nobody is replyin in their customer service chat.","151189":"Great app but has a very poor customer service. All of their representatives are a bunch of cowards hiding in the name of \"GCash Customer Care\" to avoid responsibility. Their favorite line is \"Sorry for the delay..\" as it would literally take them 2-5 days to reply. If you send a detailed report, representative will keep on asking information that were already stated. If you try to correct them, they'll be upset and will no longer reply. Their best solution is a basic troubleshooting process.","151356":"Trust me when I say this app is useless. It will waste your time and effort. A lot of system issue and the customer service tend to close the ticket even though the problem hasn't been solved yet. Paymaya is better or you can definitely open an account in any bank you prefer, much safer and convenient compared to this trashy app. If given a chance, I'm rating this a 0 star.","151380":"Nice app, it gives us easy way to send money to our family that are far from us. I just want to provide suggestion that gcash must provide one time pin(otp) every time a client will send money to avoid scammers to use our account and so that we can have oppurtunity to review every transaction that we will send. But overall i like this app cause its convenient and help us avoid crowded areas. Thank and more power gcash","151419":"I really like this app. It makes my online shopping more convenient. The transactions also are smooth. I really like the way you inform the users when you will be having a maintenance. In that case, we wouldn't wonder about what had happened.","151445":"Great app, tho I would like to suggest an easier verification for minors. This app is rated as 3+ but it doesn't accept School ID's in their verification process. They should allow students to verify using their Parents ID to make it easier. Will change my rating once applied.","151544":"Ive had a lot of trouble with sending funds to ewallets and remittances just like today. Just when you were actually in rush then, this inconvenience happened AGAIN. I called the customer service hotline, unfortunately their positive scripting make me feel worse. You cant do anything about it because you are just the receiving end? I understand how every bank's process works differently. But what made me agitated was that, the Rep didnt want to tell me the waiting timeframe for the issue. Funny.","151708":"Update after 2\/17\/20: So my issue on dispute has been resolve after a long while. And so far I don't have any problems at all. I do hope that bank transactions will be of charge and bring back the 5% rebate when you buy load. Thank you! 1 star as of 2\/17\/20: Yes it is very convenient and all but you have a very poor customer service. Its been almost 2mos that I filed a dispute but NO ONE EVER GIVE A RESPONSE or update. Who wants such a lousy service.","151721":"The app gives a multiple functions that are really handy. Edit: They finally reconsidered, the process was a bit slow but it's good enough, I would recommend this app for online transactions.. I've deleted some of my comments since it's been taken care of by the customer service.. The costuner service is nice but kind of a bit slow that is why I give this app 4 stars instead of 5.. It will be 5 stars in the future if it improves","152592":"I am so disappointed with this app. They close the tickets without even solving the problems. Its been a month since i resubmit my ticket and no one's even responding to it. I have to send money to my family for their allowance for the month of april but until now I can't send the money since they are not fixing the problem.","152922":"Every time there's an update, the dashboard resets.","152955":"Yeah it's convenient to use, but you know what?? When there's error in your transaction it will consume 5days to process even though it's your system fault, obviously they had already the proofs but they can't process the money immediately, it's regarding the cash in money \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12 stupid csr agents they didn't even know how to check the attachment first before they ask the client.","153172":"Been having trouble with this app for a few days now. And I hate how it keeps blaming my internet connection. Hello, everything else is doing fine except this app. Can't log in, even if I wait for midnight, hoping the sytem opens up better. Wala pa rin. So inconvenient, I need to send money now.","153592":"I just got fully verified. Up until now, there's always an error message before I can enter my pin. And now that I can send money, the transaction is not on transaction log? I have no Idea how to get the reference number anymore. I wasn't able to take a screenshot. It's not in sms, not in email, not in transaction logs. :( I know that Gcash is helpful, just not the app.","153627":"I cannot log in with my number anymore like it did before, its been months, still not logging in, it just says something went wrong, i dont know what to do with it anymore, i tried reinstalling it a couple times, deleting the cache, etc. Still not working, its a good thing I haven't placed any money on it when it became like this, i could have lost the 2k+ i could have put here. Please fix this.","153799":"I find this app very helpful when it comes to cashless transactions but lately it has given me a terrible headache. I wanted to pay for my electricity bill using Gcredit but it keeps on giving me an error. I submitted a ticket to have it resolved, provided the needed information for the ticket but I got no response after that. It's been a week and I still have no resolution. This app needs more improvement especially when it comes to customer care.","154154":"I have raised a ticket regarding my cash! I was charge of interest charges which I should not be, I clearly reported this issue mid April of this year, and my gcredit was cancelled I paid on time, I was getting an error when paying! If a new cycle kicks in and if the interest is still on my account case number 21403612, I will not hesitate to seek legal advice from the Securities and Exchange Commision. I want this resolve immediately.","154342":"Hi, i initially have an issue with using gcash app thru mobile data about two days ago, app works with wifi. I got plenty of data so it shouldn't be an issue witj my data. I did clear cache and clear data but still the same, it only works with wifi. So I reinstalled the app but it doesn't allow me to login now. I submitted a ticket but it didn't even generated a reference number. I will change my ratings here once the app works with mobile data once more. **Update as of may 22, its working now.","154506":"It took multiple attempts to create an account and it's not letting me verify my identity so this app is useless so far. Was told by a few people they had the same problems. Said it's like winning the lottery to get verified. Edited 5\/24 Absolute garbage. Can't verify ID or email, can't send trouble ticket and can't chat with them in their app or their Facebook. Their FB sends a verification code which is fine but when I type my PIN, sorry can't verify even though I can login to the app. TRASH","154788":"=Not good at solving costumer's problem\/s. =Didn't admit that they where in wrong. =Closing my gcredit account without a notice, that cause me to not pay my dues on time. =I submitt a ticket and didn't solve for more than 4months even if you follow up it many times. = I've been using gcash for more than 4 years but it was very inconvenient since 2020. =Escalation team didn't do there job well. =Giving a solution even though the solution they gave was your own problem.","154816":"The in-app camera is, I dont know- dumb? Blind? Or what? I've taken a photo of my ID using that feature and it was so clear and I went all the trouble to give it more lighting hoping it could make the cam see what it wants to see. But unfortunately, it send a prompt that I have to take a clearer picture of my ID. Like what? After all that? And I saw that the photo is quite clear. The apps been rendered useless to me now.","154990":"GLOBE MAKING THINGS IMPOSSIBLE!! Gsave link not working! Problem after problem","155269":"verification process is totally broken. The app cannot take a clear photo, but does not allow user to adjust settings, or use another camera app, or best option: simply upload a photo. Furthermore, the verification service is frequently unavailable and tells you to try again 6am tomorrow. What a joke.","155484":"New version 5.41 tells me I need enough gscore to use gcredit. I've been using gcredit for the longest time now and I believe I have enough gscore. None of this make sense, pleas fix this.","155511":"The app is good but I do HOPE that when there is a new version of the app, there should be an option to update later and can still be use even if it's not yet the latest version. It's so annoying. Need phone to free up space before i can update and\/or if i need it right away, i need to wait til the update is done before i can use the app to make a transaction. This option is what you lack in your app. You need to have that option too! One more thing, I can't open my Glife now. WORST!","155563":"It would be really nice to be able to change my linked email. An error message always appear with no explanation why. However, other than that and the occasional lag this app is works pretty well and quite useful. Edit: Customer support is terrible, no recommendation was given and there are no further update on my concern.","155593":"Out of every other e-wallet applications, gcash is my go-to. Aside from a very user friendly interface and a pinch of ads gcash is by far the best I had used. Although I do suggest to add an add-in money feature where users can reload their gcash using their prepaid load. That would be a convenient solution to online scams that convert load to gcash. I hope you take this into consideration, keep up the good work!","155604":"In term of Customer Services Especially about Concern and Issues about their Problem to their App, it is suck. My concern to my payment that i didnt receive still didnt finish almost 3 days without any updates to their agents. I want to encourage you to dont use this app because of slow process to their issues and problem to their app.","155741":"The verification process literally sucks. I've submitted my ticket more than thrice and even contacted the support team yet I'm not receiving any updates. You're just keep on sending me back the form. You also have a poor customer service.","155784":"customer service is very poor, response takes too long, Unresolve issues already marked resolve. update as of june 1 2021... service becomes worst as i made another accnt and verification, up to now 2days past and still pending.... receive a text and have to wait another 48hrs. Now i missed a good transaction.","155790":"Very poor customer service, I sent my concern\/request 8 days ago, and NO agent came to my response. I was expecting it to respond atleast 3 days time after I have sent my request. This is so disappointing. I'll probably delete this app if it weren't for my balance.","156130":"I have been trying to use this app, but have run into so many issues. It has been almost a week and I am still not verified. The payment I needed to make through this app had to be done a different way and now I don't have access to the money I put into my account for that payment. I would not recommend this app to others. The customer service has also been difficult to connect with. They have asked me for the same information 3 times now. I have already sent it to them, but they can't see it?","157229":"I keep comparing gcash to paymaya, and I definitely like paymaya now compare to gcash. In gcash there's always a maintenance mostly every night. they remove the load voucher which is a big help for us whose using gcash for load businesses unlike in paymaya they give 5% load voucher for every load transaction. And lastly when you cash in in 7\/11 they already get 1% convenience fee ,unlike in paymaya,yes they also get 1% convenience fee but they refunded the amount of convenience fee.","157309":"This is the best app of its kind and that's it. It's feature-heavy and still easy to use. My favorite feature would be GSave as it makes it very easy for me to save up and manage my money. Sending money is also more secure as it shows you the name of the recipient before sending the money. The little bad experiences you get with this app seem nothing and tolerable compared to the great capabilities it has. GCash is as good as it gets when it comes to E-Wallets, at least here in the Philippines.","158684":"I use it for almost one year. But always have a problem. Always have maintenance, cannot log in, sometimes load was deducted to your gcash account but they cannot received load. Then they returned on next days. They are expanding there business but maintenance or upgrading their service is good. Poor service.","159778":"After paying my Gcredit outstanding balance last month 1 week before the due date, i cannot use Gcredit anymore. I tried to use it at Puregold countless times and i was embarassed because it never worked. It always said Payment failed (i don't know why). I tried it at Mercury Drug, Watsons and Shoppee, but, to no avail. I have no idea why it never worked anymore. My Gcash app is updated to the latest version and I followed how to update Gcredit as instructed in the text blast.","159922":"It's been 5 days and I'm still not verified. I already email and sent a ticket but I didn't get proper answer. I received a notification you need to clear some details but when I click on the link it just went to help website I don't know where I need to go. My app don't have live chat option, I need assistance please.","159929":"Pros: Have lots of partnered banks and merchants: Availability as payment option is present on many stores for cashless transactions; Integrations on apps and web services like foodpanda and lazada make the transactions smoother. Cons: App UI is bloated and it feels slow and laggy; Frequent downtime and maintenance; Load rebates are no longer available; Alot of fees esp. cash in & out(no more free); No more load rebates. Will keep it since friends uses it but far lesser than before.","160034":"I make sure to passed all the requirements for account verification, I even review it all but they keep on saying there's still a lacking requirement and told me to submit another ticket but up until now I can't submit another ticket. Been trying for nth time but it keeps on going back to submit a ticket page. I even update it to the latest version but still the same result.","161361":"I hate how it keeps on updating yet is still extremely laggy when you use it. It's not smooth to navigate the app and wastes so much time. And it's also annoying how we're forced to update so many times, not even giving us a choice if we don't wanna update the app (which, like I said, still works tremendously bad, regardless of the update). Globe certainly has such an inclination towards providing slow and bad service.","162062":"Its all good now thanks","162510":"what I just hate about the app is that when i really need to Use it in urgent, an upgrade icon pops out and I can't use gcash without updating first. that time my internet was not that strong.. i ended up not using it. that made me upset. plus you can't buy load at night. i thought it's an app useful 24\/7? what if I need to buy load for emergency?","162770":"The app is conveniently operational but sometimes its inaccessible due to system clearing or update. With these, I would suggest that a text message must be sent first before undergoing system operations. Through text, we will be aware that gcash will not be used at that point in time and so we can prepare for loading in advance or cash-in advance. Thank you","163373":"This app is very useful. However, I cannot save receipts after sending money or paying. I need to use screenshot and I dont't like that. I also cannot scan a QR Code when paying. Super hassle. I already updated the app, sent a ticket but it's still the same. No action was made.","163662":"I would give 4 because their service is good especially the security of your account and they could fix your problem..","163965":"It's good and all. But there are times, I mean most of the times it's not functioning well, all it does was loading, even if I restart the app it keeps loading, what if its an emergency and I need to send money ASAP? Fix the bugs, since you keep updating and add alot of unnecessary stuff in the app. Try to fix the bugs first.","164200":"The new update would have been nice, however the feature where they show the receiver's name before you send the money is gone, and you'll only know it after you've sent the money. Please bring it back! It's very helpful for verifying whethee you're sending to the right person or not. Until then, 4\/5 stars for me.","165003":"It's really convenient and I particularly like the GCash MasterCard because it can be used as a Debit Card and a Credit card. I'm also going to try purchasing groceries with it. The customer service does need improvements because when I tried verifying my account, an automated response was sent and as a result, I didn't know exactly what I did wrong. It took me a week and several attempts to finally figure it out.","166636":"I have been having issues with this app, just this recently, this new version (5.41) doesnt let me access my account and says something about connectuon issues, Im no dumb not to consider all troubleshooting steps, I also use an android 10 version so clearly not my phone either. I hipe the company gives attention to its clients especially addressing this concern.","166957":"I thought the app was good. I was trying to verify my account using Student ID thru requesting a ticket. It's been 7 days and still no updates. I submitted twice and still in the process of what? It is true that the customer service is dull, as in. I'm tired seeing we apologize for what you have experienced with no action to resolve at all. I give 1 star, because there's no option for zero.","167122":"The app is really useful and convenient. However, recently I've encountered problem regarding this app I can't open my account and I kept on updating but still it doesn't work. I've been waiting for a long time to finish updating the app but their is no sign of progress until now. Please do something about my issues.","167289":"I have been using this app for quite some time now.. I would have given 5 stars but then I will reserve 1 star for the better services in the future.. I used to like this app a lot when I used to get 5% rebate in its loading feature. Then they removed it and replace it with \"Load2win\" scratch scheme which does not always work. The service ended without me playing all the scratch and win entries and vouchers not being credited(sad \ud83d\ude0c). Now the latest is the Cash-in charges in 7\/11 of up to 2%. \ud83d\ude2b","168712":"My cashed in was successful per email confirmation of my bank but it did not reflect in my gcash account. Need the money urgently as today is my due date for bills payment. So disappointed with this app.","169230":"It's very useful app thank you so much., Sometimes I never out side to pay our water and electricity bill...because I have this app, so I opened immediately then pay our bills, also I'm buying loads here, all network have especially my numbers tm and globe.. Sometimes I'd play also here by G-Cash game.. it's so amazing so what are you waiting for just download,and I'm pretty sure you're \ud83d\udcaf percent enjoy it every time.","169867":"As I've said before, a feature where you can see the message you sent to someone so that you can track down your expenses when budgeting. Also, I do have two accounts from GCash and every time I log out on the other, I always end setting up the features I mainly use on my home page. I think this should be improved and seeing that their customer service is far less than their consumers, there is no assistance whatsoever.","170172":"Very poor customer service. Submitted a ticket almost a month ago but the status is still \"processing\". Lots of follow ups have been done but still no progress.","170539":"I've been using cashless method for years now and this app is the worst. I transferred cash to CoinsPH & the recipient didn't receive it even if it was via Instapay. The customer support kept telling me that I should wait 3-5 days for the recipient to receive it. After 3 days, I got a message that the transaction was unsuccessful & that I will get the money back to my account. After a couple of follow-ups, I still didn't get the refund & their customer support is the worst. Don't trust this app!","170654":"There's no notification whenever the server goes down, not even the social medias tell when the server is down, really inconvinient at some times and theres no refund when there's a load that wasn't sent yet deducted to your account, overall a horrible experience except for the times it actually works as intended, I hope you improve these flaws first before adding more functions","170868":"My previous problem with verification was solved, but now I'm facing a new one. I cannot pay through a generated QR code. It always says \"Sorry! Our system is busy. Please try again later\" even when I have sufficient balance in my GCash account (not GCredit). It's been like this for a while now. What's going on? There are no alerts for any ongoing maintenance. EDIT: NOW I CAN'T WITHDRAW MY MONEY FROM ANY ATM. FIX THIS OR SO HELP ME I WILL SEND ALL MY MONEY ELSEWHERE.","171327":"Why they always saying your photo is unclear even it is clear.what is the problem i always took a clear photo of my i.d but still not accept.i am tired to this.depressing.","171657":"I sent a ticket regarding my verification process a week ago and up until now there's no response. I can't cash-out the money. It's always ' our agents will get back to you shortly'!","171715":"at first it was awesome cause it has some discount when i'm buying ml diamond but when i buy 100 garena shells they did not send the e-pin.they say i need to submit a ticket and i already do it but it's already been 2 days still nothing happened. disappointing.","171763":"Been using this app since the pandemic happened and it has been a great help but I never knew that they could just block you from accessing your funds citing \"highly unusual activity\" and then never respond even after you've fulfilled all their requirements within the hour. It has been 14 days since and has caused me a lot of stress and anxiety. No response up to this day. Edit: it has now been a month since I couldn't log in and access my funds. What happened to my money?!","171811":"Better not to use this app. So disappointing. I sent money to my friend for 2000+ pesos. On my end, it was successfully sent but never received by the recipient. Recipient call Gcash customer service but she was informed that it's \"GLITCH\" and they will not cover it. IT WAS YOUR APP IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THE TRANSACTION WAS EXPRESS SEND. THAT'S GCASH TO GCASH PROCESS. WHERE'D THE MONEY GO THEN? WE KEEP ON CALLING FOLLOWING UP BUT NEVER RECEIVED PROPER RESOLUTION.","172111":"It's useful and user-friendly, but I'm currently encountering a problem in buying load. Ever since the last update, after inputting the cellphone number and form of load needed, clicking Next, I am presented with a blank white screen. The cellphone number nor the form of load doesn't seem to affect what happens, only blank white screens where I expect a confirmation page. In case it's needed my phone is a Huawei CHM-U01.","172344":"I've been using this app for more a 1 year\/half and it seems good. But after they updated the app for several times i can't use my gcredit. All in all its still a good app. Load rebates should be back soon.","172521":"Sometimes when I try to load my phone number, the app malfunctions I had to repeatedly refresh and relaunch. It also runs in my background on it's own, whenever I try to close it my phone is still showing notifications that it's still running. Lastly, I hope this app is accessible without data. I wanted to pay stuff I buy from 711 using GCash however without data it's impossible, just suggesting though it would really make a great difference.","172593":"Ever since CIMB had made changes to GCash it has been annoying, with all of the charges and changes in policies. I used to be able to use the app without much problems. I was able to freely use my GCredit before now they state that my GScore is not \"HIGH\" enough where no where in ANY of their policies show what number is \"HIGH\" enough. Their customer support has not been helpful.","172767":"It doesn't let me verify my account for more than a year now. It always says 'Upgrade in Progress'. Gcash help center is not helpful and their contact services don't respond properly. I've seen a lot of people encounter this problem and has not been able to verify their accounts for more than a year. Please fix this.","172852":"I can't even use the app to transfer or do anything on it. Because of the verification is way too far from reality for me to be validated. I was too excited to use the app but because it needed to wait for the verification i still end up on waiting for more than 24 hours just to use my own money. Very frustrating and So disappointed for this app. Already sent a ticket but no one send me feed back yet.","173249":"Unreliable service. There were numerous times that transfer will fail, but money will be deducted from my bank amd it usually take days for my money to be credited back to my bank account. I have been using gcash for more than 3 years almost everyday to pay bills and buy load but instead of upgrading my score it was constantly been downgraded.","173337":"Easy to use and very user friendly. However, there are times that Updates are sudden or the app is down resulting for a chaos at times of emergency, but aside from that it's smooth sailing.","173767":"Buggy as hell for the past month. Slow login and opening of everything and then the dreaded 'try again later'. They kept adding features but you can't use it. 9july2021 update: now I can't login. After typing MPIN. Nothing happens. And they want to be the future of Fintech in PH. Good luck with that.","173790":"WHAT.IS.WRONG.WITH.GCASH?! I can't seem to log in for the past two weeks. I just woke up one day and my account was as logged out. I thought it was just some bug that needed fixing so I didn't mind it too much. But now that I am trying to access it because I need something, I just can't? Please tend to this. It's been two weeks. Will change the rating if my problem is fixed. Thank you","175152":"It's functioning for the most part but I constantly have problema with buying load. It will not allow me to press the amount or type it, they are just gray out. This happens ALL the time! I tried loading my Globe number and it worked but when I try to load my TNT it didn't so what's wrong?","175336":"Very poor customer service, they never replied to tickets! They should just include other ids that were listed when submitting tickets for verification, like NBI clearance and such, so that we don't have to reach their poor customer service, in that way, their users will save a lot of time than waiting for no reply!","175368":"The app is convenient however if you encounter to change the phone number that is registered on the account they have underrated action. It will take 72 hours for to undergo the verification process but at the end they will just send you another ticket that you have to wait for another 72 hours. Please improve your action on this aspect.","175535":"Its more on hassle free and Enjoying on cashless transaction. Its very easy to have this application . Just download on the playstore and install it on our mobile phone. Theres a lot of opportunity to use this on our daily transaction especially that we are on pandemic time that almost 70 percent of peoples activity are online. So its really helpful and significant on having gcash application on our mobile phone so what i can say ultimately or lastly is to have and enjoy this app.","176299":"If there is an option to make a zero star rating, I would really really choose it. Student ID is not included on the list of the IDs that can be used to get fully verified. I submitted a ticket but I got nothing. Now I tried to use TIN ID but it is also not included on the list. My God Gcash, I would rather verify my PayPal account first than wasting my time verifying my account in yours.","176512":"The verification process is easy but the time it takes for them to verify your account is taking too long, I have experience inconveniences because of this and I cannot proceed to any transactions due to this. Please verify the accounts faster.","176921":"Very poor customer service. I have followed the steps and sent clear images of my ID and other documents needed for verification yet my application was still rejected, the help center also takes so long to respond. This app is so unreliable especially during this pandemic.","177237":"Services are always unavailable and transactions appear in history after 24 hours which is very inconvenient... SO MUCH HASSLE... They're not transparent to the client as well about the point system they're using .. so you wouldn't know what progress your making and maybe they're not giving much credit to your activities.. Pinoy na Pinoy!","177259":"Convenient until they put your money on hold for days when it's not even your fault. I was just trying to transfer money to my bank, but for some reason on their end, it didn't push through. I contacted support, but I was advised to wait. Yep, I would advise my bills to wait. If the transfer was not a success, why can't you just return it right away so I can find other ways to get the money to my bank?","177467":"This app is very convenient that's what I like it, honestly in the beginning I've been struggling how get fully verified my account using my student ID, but it takes too long for them to response, I've been trying not just twice,but many\ud83d\ude0a I got to irritate \ud83d\ude0aand then after few days I got an email saying my Gcash Account is fully verified. I am extremely happy\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc9cThanks for the good service\ud83d\ude0aGod Bless you all\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude07","177668":"Convenient sana. Manual verification takes so long to get processed. It's been 2 weeks and mine is still processing. Customer service is also not that reachable, takes hours, even days before they respond pa. When they respond, it's the same reason, kinda feels like you're talking to a wall. Services are not the same as it used to. Hopefully, ma-improve na soon.","177790":"CS was awful! Gcash is a big help app but you should have an option to unfriend someone stealing your hard earned green energy. Also, it would be better if there's a notification that our green energy is ready since it does not generate real time after a transaction is done. That way, we don't need to check it from time to time since we have a lot of things to do, work, and stuffs, for us to keep checking that so others can't steal it. Plus the CS is not helpful, issue left unsolved.","178422":"The app is great, especially with their savings account. I love the interest. Very convenient app. However, outages happen very often so I gave it 4 stars. Overall, this is app is very helpful.","178572":"Its such a big help especially now but the transaction fee is too much. When I cash in there's a deduction, when I cash out over the counter there is still a deduction fee. A lot of people uses this app, it is a big help if you lower the transaction fee.","178671":"The verification process are so long and difficult for new users like me. I already send and provide all of my priv info but still in the end, I'm not still verified. Hopefully they can make it easier when it comes to verified function in the next updates.","179318":"I bought something online and used gcash as mode of payment, the app said my balance is exactly as the value of the product i was buying. I thought it was just reading it wrong so i paid for it. I went to the app and my balance really isn't the same as thr product i had a glimpse of my balance before the app deducted what i just spent. That's unacceptable. Pls fix this gcash i know what i lost was not much it was just around 20php or so but what if the balance was bigger?","179370":"Very convenient, fast and reliable. Your money is really secure and if you maintain a good gscore you can avail their other product such as gcredit and gloan.","180616":"One of their best e wallet payment systems, I love that they feature Ginsure, Ginvest and Glife options among others; ease of payment for bills, smooth payment of transactions made easy with a clean and user friendly interface. Rarely have any glitches. Keep it up!","183065":"It's okay i guess. My only problem is that i had 97php on my unverified account, my phone is not open line and my sim say its not \"provisioned\". I can't receive texts or messages anymore. I can't open my account due to the code that you will need to recieve via text. Please have another option like a gmail account or even add another number as an emergency. And please give me back my 97 pesos.","184144":"As of Aug 2, upgraded to 4 stars. Resolution are getting swifter.","184845":"When I first used this platform, I thought that It wouldn't be useful, but for months now, I can say that this is so HELPFUL. I love the fact that I can use this e-wallet with such convenience and safety. I can cash in some money through their free of charge kiosk. I can pay my bills and shopee pay with ease. I love this! If I could just rate this more than 5 stars I would. Thank you GCash","188464":"Appreciated the update. Please improve more on the bills payment email. Most of the time I'm not receiving any confirmation email. Eventhough you are sending text messages, confirmation email provides more details than a text message especially when paying SSS contributions.","189615":"This app helped a lot during this pandemic. However, why can't I save my credit card info for the bills payment? If it's just one time payment, I can pay just fine. But when I'm trying to save it, there's always an error and it won't accept my credit card info. Make it make sense. I'm putting the same info but Gcash insist that there is something wrong with it whenever I'm trying to save it.","190143":"I love this app, but I rate it 3 stars for now because I'm waiting to see the ff: - More banks supported to link to, as required for higher limits (BPI, Unionbank, etc. is fine but it's not what I have, and so does other people) - Be able to see the remaining limit for the day and month ( I had a business transaction cancelled all because I've reached monthly wallet size limit) ....the other app I'm using have these, so I will change my rating to 5 star once the devs implemented these on the app","190635":"The app itself is very useful, but the Support team isn't. I have 2 tickets already, but none of them are resolved. I got 2 simple concerns, but they ask for a lot of things, even an ID, when my account is already verified. They have the worst customer service team in the world.","192452":"I've been using gcash for more than 2 years now and it has been improving alot. From the services offered to customer service. Kudos to the gcash team for making it a lot easier to navigate and for opening new features such as padala and many more. However, gcash team please allow students to fully verify their accounts using their IDs since many now are struggling to verify their accounts for not having the required IDs, though we understand that it is for safety purposes it. Thank you.","192730":"The app had been useful but lately it has poor customer service. We erroneously cashed in last july 25 and immediately reported in gcash help but until now there had been no acknowledgment of our submitted ticket nor did they gave us a ticket to track our concern. Everyday we submit tickets on the same matter. We called the hotline 2882 but we were not able to talk to any customer service representative to help us. They will just divert us to the same way of submitting ticket.","193491":"This app has really poor customer service. I've been trying to verify my account for a week now and still upgrade on progress. I even contacted gcash support on email but they'll only reply after a day. How much days will i going to wait before i get verified? The customer service even asked me to fill out some information. They asked me to send photos and all. They even asked me to upload file which i did and they said they couldn't open it. Then again, they asked me send it in pdf and...","193758":"If there is No star i would rate this 0!!! Very poor costumer service! They don't even update us about the verification of our account. You guys should know how important the money we have in the account. Please give us an update. I tried to contact them everywhere but there's not a single reply. Be considerate to your costumer. It's been 6 days!!!!!","194702":"This application was very useful specially now that we are in pandemic, it makes us easy to pay or to buy what we need. Though, sometimes, it's crash when we need to transfer to the bank but it's not always and they make sure that we can make a transaction a soon as it will okay. Good work\ud83d\udc4c","195006":"Hi Gcash team, If you are planning a system maintenance, please text user or email us a day before. Yes your app is very convenient for daily transactions, but unannounced maintenance is not so convenient at all. Make priority with your app, especially during these times as most users do cashless transactions to be hygienic too. Hope you notice this review. Thanks","195012":"The app is good but it always crashed. Just sent my funds there for emergency but I cant use it because of glitch running in the app.. I already tried to reach out gcash customer hotline.. but no one answer. Poor customer service..","195501":"This application is very helpful especially in this time of pandemic where people cannot go outside to buy and pay bills,it is also very useful in ordering foods,groceries and everything we need inside our house,were not able to go outside to buy we can send our payment through this application.This application also can be a source of our income by loading loads or sending money..It is very easy to use..thankyouuuuuu soo mucccchhh forrr the creaaatoooor offf thissss application..Very usefullllll","195678":"This app is not really working properly. Ive been denied for how many times for my account to be fully verified. I keep submitting required documents and correct information yet still got denied. The only reply I got is either to let me send ANOTHER TICKET of concern or my application is denied. Better to switch to another app if this continues. Sorry but I will really give 1 star. Hope you'll improve and make your verification faster!","195953":"Just installed the app, had so many attempts to verify mobile pin. Fortunately it went through after maybe 8-10th try. It's going well until the verification process of identification card. I'm sending the correct picture but gives an error when sending the image. Can't verify right now since it said I already made too many failed attempts. Going to try the process tonight or tomorrow. Update (after a few weeks): Seems like verification using SSS ID have issues. Other ID worked.","196297":"Works great with express send but when sending to banks, doesn't always have an acknowledgement of the transaction whether by email or in-app even when the funds have already been deducted from my account. And that's a problem when you need proof that you're transferred the money. Used to be more reliable.","197219":"The verification process takes a really long time. Tried verifying my account a few times already but was always rejected because the other IDs option is basically useless. The app is also useless when the account is not verified. Please fix this!!!","199618":"I wish there was a zero star. The help center does not care whatever you eplain or write to them. They just auto message back. The verification is the nightmare when it gets to upgrade in progress..they keep sending email please log in to validate the verification..there is no option to validate anything because it is in progress for past 9 days..the help desk should rely on and use their human capability, common sense and skills that replying on AI. The worst support ever I have noticed","199644":"I'm not saying that this app is bad but the verification process for students is HELL, it made me so frustrated and stressfull, like it is intentionally making fun of me!, ive send EVERYTHING it needs and a message said it is now verifiying and then... a msg said I NEED TO SEND ALL AGAIN, this went days!, until now i'm still not verified....","200101":"I can't even log in to the app even when I have a stable internet. what is this? in the verification process as well, the options for I.D are just limited. The reason I downloaded this app is for convenience in cashing out and in but it seems like its harder with the bugs and limitations of this app.","200915":"I'm having trouble login in due to a lost sim card and I sent them a ticket but they keep responding with automated messages regarding their downtime that has nothing to do with my concern. I'll only change this when they properly address my concern like they should. I love this app but the customer service sucks!","201427":"Verification process frustrate me so much, 3 minutes turned into 24 hours to 72 hours to 7 days and after 7 days still not verified. Customer service just keep saying that my account still pending like why? Customer service doesn't help at all !!!","201731":"I've had a good experience so far, and I hope it'll continue. I was quite hesitant before because of the bad reviews I've heard before with security and all that. A request, can you guys add an option to receive our authentication code via email? Our location has a rather weak signal connection, it's usually 0-1 bars or \"SOS only\" kinda thing. Thank you, and keep doing a good job!","201907":"The app is discriminatory against PWDs. I can't verify my account because I can't blink to take a selfie owing to my facial paralysis. When I use messenger, I'm always told to \"please try again later.\" I also can't find the pawnshop where I can verify. I've contacted GCash care via messenger re: my conern, and they answer me with how to recover my MPIN. I have to repeat my concern. When they aren't able to give a satisfactory answer, they ignore me. Until now (8\/25\/2021), I still can't verify","202529":"I just sent my verification request last August 2. Until now, it hasn't verified yet. I used the help center option to send my request because there is no other options of ID. I clearly explained about why I want to make another Gcash account because I have a new number. I attached many pictures holding many ID's. And also my father's first Gcash account hasn't verified yet. We're both waiting for it. Please... please Gcash verified it. It's almost a month already. pleeeeease im begging...","202533":"Outstandingly UNRELIABLE. I tried cashing out my balance then later on found myself stuck in the traffic due to this poor system. Ya'll have alot of partnerships but any of them aren't even reliant. I've been to alot of your cash out withdrawal centers only to be told multiple times that \"their service is unavailable atm\", \"we're currently offline\" at every different place! So much hassle!","202605":"This app is the WORST. Don't fool us in hoping to get verified. I've been waiting for weeks and strictly complying with the requirements even sending additional documents. In the end, I didn't get verified???!!!! What a trash app! Also, saying that an agent of yours will contact me for the concern but, in the end, no agent accomodate me???!! Your support sucks. So TERRIBLE.","202914":"Very useful and easy to use digital wallet. Can be used even without regular load and mobile data. With their partnership with CIMB bank, it's more convenient to save up. The widgets in the home screen make it a lot easier to conduct different financial transactions.","203359":"Its pretty stupid that the loading app doesn't always work when you want them to. I always set an alarm 5min before my data expires and just when i needed it most it stops working. \"It says, service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.\" Been like this for the whole freaking day now. Its just the worse.","203730":"Having problem with my gcash savings, I cant withdraw for 5 days. Already submitted ticket and they said that it is known issue and closed ticket as resolved but definitely not... Sucks!","204288":"having some trouble issues need to fix that's why i only give 1 star and below. i don't like the service at all.","204496":"Love \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96 it.its easy to use especially sending money to love ones,and buying loads.\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70,make payments is Soo easy.","204672":"I really like this app before they update their system but now everytime I switch to diff number, the app stuck up...

What happen?! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","204732":"I dunno why people getting so mad at this app, all app has flaws but this app certainly help me save my money online. Sure we encounter problem but it still serve it's purpose and I haven't lose any money. Thanks gcash, I don't have a bank account right now so I'm happy that I can still save online.","205092":"I'll using this apps almost a year but now this month of September when the apps need to update, I ready update but afterward when I change a number to log in, very very loading. You can't log in if you can't, uninstall and install again. Please make your customer easy not to make us hard.","206005":"I can't login to my account. They said update my app, uninstall and reinstall. Still nothing worked! I agree with the rest of the feedback here. It doesn't work when you need it to work. Frustrating!","208155":"Very useful especially now that there is a pandemic. I give 4 stars just because it is not perfect and needs more improvements but nevertheless, it is one great app now more than ever because every transaction is starting to be online.","208565":"I have dificulty logging in to my gcash ...it keeps on spinning and waiting for log in... Whats the problem. I hope you can address the solution asap!!! Is there a system error in your app now?","208953":"very convenient, smooth transfer specially to bank accounts. Load, Bank, Wallet and Money Transfer anywhere and anytime All, in one platform. This is so smart and amazing! Fast and No charges! or very low for other bank transactions. Highly Recommended.","211849":"I keep sending a ticket about your PayPal cash in, my money needs to be withdrawn from your app but the PayPal cash in option seems to always be in a problem most of a time. Now it just says it's unable to process my request. Please FIX THIS situation. I HATE THIS APP! IM ALWAYS UNABLE TO CASH IN MY MONEY EVERY TIME I F##KING NEED IT.","214091":"I have changed my review from a negative one to a neutral one. I'm giving out 5 stars because of GCredit's big help in my everyday life. Really hoping to update my GCredit account.","214959":"It tells me to check my internet connection even though I use my wifi or data connection. It is really inconvinient when I really need a cash to buy credits online and then suddenly it pops out unto my screen and tells that to check my internet connection. Also it takes a long time to process the processing loading screen even though I have good connection with my internet.","215132":"very HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! GSave would often times do system update and if u needed to withdraw some of ur money from it, u wont be able to do so unless the update was completed which would take almost a day to complete it. i even got embarrassed at a grocery store one time, when i tried to pay my groceries at the cashier and i tried to transfer funds from GSave to GCash and it wouldn't let me because GSave suddenly had system update w\/o prior notice, leaving me empty handed as i left the store!","215242":"I have been using this app for a year and Gcash is very a helpful for me who do Commission. But this year this app is giving me a headache. When I'm going to open the app something will pop up and saying I should update it first and this month it getting worse. Just like of other review I can't open my account. It just keep on loading. Please fix this as soon as possible because I have a money on there that I will use for my online class \ud83d\ude2d","215368":"No wonder this is top one in the finance apps. Even though they have frequent system upgrades, this app has been very helpful and convenient. It's also easy to use. Charges may be a little bit pricey but it's okay. This is so much better than the e-wallet app of their competitor network.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d","216293":"I had to switch accounts for a bit. When i tried to log in, it just froze as loading on the login page. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but it didn't recognize my MPIN even if it was correct. Now I'm locked out of my account and retrieval of account has been difficult. Horrible company. I wish i didn't need it.","217917":"Recently I have the worst experience on GCash app. I paid using QR code and was deducted right away from my account. But the merchant never received the text confirmation same on my end. So the merchant did not release the merchant I paid. It took 5 hours before I received the text. I have to wait for 2 hours at the store until the manager talked to me that she will contact me once they receive the text. Very poor service. Few years back GCash was really good. Most of the time GCash is not resp","218119":"There is no transaction history for most dates. When you request for a certain transaction history copy thru their email, there is always an auto reply and a ticket is given but there is no resolution & the request was not resolve.

The list just goes on.","221736":"I love the way this app helps me to keep my money safe.

But now I was enjoying using the app. It is very useful to me and my friend; instead of bringing cash, we used this app as our digital pocket money-in the grocery, when purchasing snacks or meals, and when paying bills.It is also easier for us to save money in our bank account through GCash bank transfer,investments, and savings.Furthermore,it was enjoyable to use this app because it provided numerous freebies.Sana free cash in","234718":"Always asking for an update! Then been trying to update it this past few days but it keeps on loading and nothing's happening! Checked my internet but it's fine. Tried many times to uninstall then install again but it's still asking me to update it! It's soooooo frustrating! I can't update it and can't use it properly. Please do something about this.","234773":"Always down with technical issues. We are sorry is all they can say. TOO MANY UPDATES AND YOU CANNOT USE IT IF YOU DO NOT DO A USELESS UPDATE WHICH ONLY PROMOTES THEIR PRODUCTS NOT PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE!!! If vendors have other payment portals I would use that instead!! \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e","234925":"Im really disappointed in this app, after buying game credits in this app I'm pretty sure they will send me a text message containing the reference number and the code but after waiting for almost 3 hours there is still no text from them. Please fix this problem immediately.","235130":"i decided to change my old no. with a new no. but after filling out some details needed, at the email part, i cant put my whole email address. i thought regardless of how long an email a user has, there's no limit of characters to input. what can you suggest about it? thank you","235547":"I've tried to cash in using my bank account but it has been three days already and the money I cash in wasn't reflected on my GCASH account. I've tried to contact but says there's no available chat for the meantime. Tried to create a trouble ticket but it won't go through, crashes and won't even hover the date of transaction. It's so frustrating that even now I don't know where my money goes.","235871":"I hate the new update, where you can't input a specific amount anymore, and it doesn't detect right away what network you're buying load for. That feature was very convenient. But now no more. Updqting to 3 stars since I use this app for the load transactions 50% of the time.","237383":"Always on system maintenance or error. Grrrr. Last night i purchased 90pesos load for my globe sim,it said that the transaction wasn't successful 'cause i took so long to confirm but I wasn't took long to confirm. I repeated the process and i was charged double! If only I had a choice I wouldn't download this app! 10-24-2021 Nothing change Gcash! I submitted ticket 10-22-2021 regarding money trasfer but until now no one reach me out to lend help!that was money deducted on my acc but cant claim!","237415":"My number 1 problem on this app is the verification process I can't send money to a friend without completely verifying myself and I'm still a student and their is no choice in where a student ID is required to verify yourself which is a pain since its difficult to get other types of ID verification because of Covid pandemic","237705":"I cash in my wallet but I cant send my money and its already 3 months and you dont respond to my ticket because up until now my verification process still on the process its already 6 months i asked your customer support.. Very poor customer service! Give me back my money!!!","237753":"I will give this app a 5star because this app really helps us especially now with the pandemic facing the whole country. That no one needs to go out to buy necessities. This is where you can buy the things you need and this app makes it easier to send money to those you want to send and it also makes it easier for you to get the money that will also be sent to you and even your other bills that you can pay. also get paid using this app.\u2764\ufe0f","237805":"Please, can you fix the app? After I cash in, I can't open the app. After a few transactions, I can't open again the app. So I always uninstall and install the gcash app all over again .","238031":"I'm not sure if it's because of the latest update or probably due to a technical problem but I'm having a hard time verifying my account using my Student ID since everytime I use a ticket to voice out my concerns - there are no more options for it. The customer service told me to go to the nearest Villarica branch to be verified but what if there's no Villarice branch within the city? I do hope they'll put it back or atleast read this review of mine.","238051":"Despite having some technical issues sometimes, this is still a 5 star for me. GCash saved me this pandemic. From GSave, GCredit, Alipay to GLoan and every feature in it, it was REALLY a great help. I can also use the virtual card to pay my subscription such as Netflix and the GCredit can be used to purchase from Google Play which is very convenient. Thank you, GCash!! \ud83d\udc96","238434":"I have this app for almost a year and honestly it's not that bad and very useful since I downloaded it. I mostly use this app for the purpose of buying a load, the features is nice you can customize regular load, and with different categorise to choose of which type of unli you prefer. But after the latest updates it downgraded, there is no more customize load, and the choices of categorise got lessen. I like this app since before, and yet this latest update is ruining it.","238665":"Very unreliable. Paymaya can do better than this. It's always having errors while using the app.","238904":"Great app! Appreciate the hardworking team behind this, thank u. Would just like to suggest having an update to bring huge performance improvement in virtually all compatible devices to provide smooth and seamless experience while using the app since it still has some hiccups here and there, and maybe add more utility to the app? Such as trading crypto? If only possible, many thanks.","238947":"I don't like the update. It's better to have the option to write the amount you want to load. And it was nicer if they can return autodetect what your sim is and already have all the best offer. Now I can't even click the contact icon on buying load.","239010":"The app is a good way to do cashless transactions, my only problem is with their support process... You need to create a ticket for your concern and they will communicate via email. What if your concern needs immediate attention? You're goong to have to wait for their response. I also tried to send a message on their facebook page but it seems to be unresponsive.","239081":"Overall its great but when you need help specially in input errors.. You are just a sitting duck.. No response or it will take a long while to be addressed. Be careful in your data input as there are no customer service in this app.. I experienced it.. It could have been resolve asap if there are just someone in the customer services to follow up your case... Update to this. it took almost 48 hours but I got my money back so it still great...thanks Gcash!","239086":"We're having a trouble about recovering an account because we're about to pay for something but then it logged out by itself and now even if you put your number it's not working, it needed a verification which was pretty annoying because we're not receiving any message or code from gcash. I hope that it will be fix as soon as possible, I need that account.","239527":"Hello? Why's this loading service keeps changing the process to load? And now there's only two choices of mobile network. How to load Globe\/TM when there's only Smart\/TNT mobile network? Hoping to fix this issue right away, and it'll be better to put back for some reason the automatic mobile network identifier. Thank you","239840":"Terrible to use. It would be best if Globe would hire a new App Developer, the team who is working on the app right now sucks to the core. In less than a year this app requires more than 5 updates, how awful is that? Maintenance will often be conducted without prior notice, not a good thing to do.","239844":"Bug problem for android: just a few days ago, when I buy load, I am unable to change the phone number when I tap on the phonebook icon. The phonebook icon is active for tapping, but it doesn't prompt me to the contact list when I tap it. I would then need to enter the phone number manually if the no. is different than mine. Pls fix. PS. this is not the case when I buy load using GCash thru my iPad. Thanks","239921":"The apps provided good services but the only downfall is the verification process since sometimes it does not support student ID. And also I have already my national ID but it couldn't verify the back part when scanning. I hope this will be resolved asap.","239966":"Gsave and ginvest is good. No more cashback\/load voucher is a disappointment, alipay rewards always says already redeemed but nothing shows and also it's bad that transactions cannot be viewed on the activity realtime.","240239":"It was ok before when the update is not yet done. But now it sucks, when your about to purchase a load sometime globe and tnt are not availble, and also you cant change the number via phonebook when your loading you need to copy or paste it manually. Sometimes also when your loading it will says its already successful but after a few minutes the load will be back and will said it was not.","240383":"The new update it seems not nice for me, i can't typed the manual amount of load that i need to send to my customer like manually ex(5 php,25 php, or 40 php of regular load) and also you can't tapped the contact even the option is there..the old version is better than the new update...pls, remove the option if Globe,smart or tnt 'coz i keep asking my costumer, before it convenient but the new UPDATE is HASSLE \ud83e\udd28 \u2b50rating will change rise when i observe good changes of this apps","240523":"Unreliable customer service. so many hidden charges. i uninstalled the app and switched to Smart and DITO.","240604":"3rd review. They do be removing reviews aren't they?","240876":"good","241544":"Currently I love the set of functions of there app, however the customer support wasn't available in anytime of the day especially in Emergency situations case's, Secondly some of applications sections are not functioning at all especially there Gcredit sections sometimes you need to wait for so long before the merchant received the reference number.","241838":"Honestly I love gcash because it easy to use but when it come to verification I send ticket several times to get fully verify my account and wait for about 1 week unfortunately there no update with regard in verification process because untill now it's upgraded in progress I'm sorry to say it but I'm loosing trust to use gcash","241891":"Super awful costumer service. They cannot be contacted personally, plus their costumer service cannot be reached via phone call. Many issues with the app. I cannot log in.","242119":"ONE STAR only because ZERO is not an option. Another update and another total disappointment. This time all of my billers disappeared. Now I have to rebuild AGAIN. WHEN are you guys going to put your customers first and field a functional program that doesn't totally jack up the user experience?","242316":"Very bad verification process! Its very clear that all my ID's have clear shot and it still says \"photo unclear\"? your team has the most stupid verification system. thats probably y many are switching to othe vp method.","242362":"EDITED. AWFUL. Almost always \"temporarily unavailable\". Just when I need it the most. When it's up and working, the app isnt that responsive too. PLUS Removing the Prepaid load conversion to Gcash is a dumb move. Instead of doing ways to make transactions easier, you just added to the frustration of your customers. And lastly, your cash in partners suck. Fix that and you will get a better rating which i highly doubt. PS: MONTHS HAVE PASSED STILL THE SAME ISSUE MY GOD","242620":"There's always an issue on the app. I use gsave and 90% of the time i encounter errors. Not even allowing me to use my own money. Its easy to deposit. So easy you wont break a sweat. But when you need to withdraw to use the money, you will encounter errors preventing you to do so.","242656":"Always fixing things Unavailable,always update.

I dunoo what's happening to your development.","242929":"This application help me alot upon doing all the transaction, like sending money, paying bills, buy load etc. Also customer service of gcash center is very accommodating and they act on point to resolve your concern .

This is really frustrating specially when I dont have enough data to update your application!!","244571":"It is a very useful app nowadays. But what I hate was sometimes you really need to update the app before using it. What if it is an emergency or a rush transaction? You can't use it unless update it","245126":"It's quite good at first, but lately i always experience hard time to open this app, i don't know, i always update whenever you asked to, but it's still the same and getting worst to open.","245805":"I ask assistance to their help services because my Gcredit is not working. I reported it many times so that they can fix it ASAP but until now the issue was not resolved. My Gcredit is not getting any additional points and it stock for only 350 points. Before it may happen, I have 950 points for my Gcredit then after I made some transactions it was auto decrease to 750 down to 350 points and it never been added for a long time. I was seek for any help from GCASH but no action was taken.","246146":"Edit: Nov 21, 2021 Is there an issue again today? I can't open the app Very convenient and useful app especially now in times of pandemic. Hassle free digital banking in the comfort of our homes for payment of bills, buy load, send money and cash in. I also love the GForest feature! Though lately I noticed that there are missing\/no energy points a day after paying bills and QR. Can your support please check on this? Thanks!","246150":"It is a great app. It's convenient to use. Only sometimes difficulty to open maybe because of poor network. If you don't have load data cannot transfer money.","246282":"It's convenient and much easier to use when making online transactions. Sending money to anywhere as long as the recipient has a valid bank or Gcash account, and paying bills as well. It is totally amazing.","247866":"This app is great however when it comes to buying load, they removed the feature wherein we can buy load at any amount or customized value more than Php 5.00. I would give this a five star rating if they could just bring that feature back.","248888":"I wanted to be verified. I submitted tickets everyday and they replied with same thing like mismatched information , error or something. I can't use the money to pay for online transactions. If you could help me that would be nice, I've submitted 12 ticket in april and gave up on it. I'm trying now again but it's the same. You disappoint me g-cash before it's easy to be verified but now its like finding a needle on dark a place.","249404":"Buy load is terrible. You cant even get your cash back and the new update is not anymore convinent.","249962":"I ordered my gcash mastercard but it is almost a month now and it has not been delivered yet. I submitted a ticket several times now but no one is responding to me. They kept on saying it will be escalated to a manager, but still nothing happen. It is so annoying already as I need my card. You have a poor customer service. You asked me to unlink my old card from my old account and asked me to order a new card. And now here's what happened.","250501":"Fast and convenient to use when purchasing, buying load and bill's payment online. Yet one thing i didn't like in my continued usage of this app even if my gscore is high I could no longer use my gcredit in paying for my bills, online purchase and others....","251721":"Hi GCash developer just wanted to say this is so cool, more convinient and so easy tool when it comes to emergency online transactions & I love it and what I wanted to suggest please include top up for Loads so that we can easily make our unused load go to Gcash instead of wasting since this is Globe and Tm powered app more people will use Globe and Tm if you make it easier for people to top their extra load useful and make it more easier when financial struggles triggers \"Just Load & top it up\"","251785":"I'm very disappointed about this app. They took my money from my remittance via Western Union. I did cash it in. But it won't get into my account. They already took my money and they not giving me any receipts from my transaction.my fiance called western union they said that I already picked up my money thru gcash. But I don't have money in it.","252351":"This is my 4th time uninstalling and installing the app. When I'm trying to access it, it shows the app settings not the actual app. I'm not sure if it is because of the lastest update. I hope you'll fix it very soon.","252864":"Update is always giving me a headache!","253741":"Pretty handy app, only complaint is the mandatory update every 2 weeks. Don't have much space left on my phone and have to clear cache on my other apps just to free up space for the update. If only it wasn't required","254440":"I transferred my money into another bank, and I used a verified email account for the confirmation receipt. But until now, I haven't received it yet. The first time I transferred money, it also took a couple of days before it went to my email. Hope you fix this problem.","254847":"ive been using this app for quite sometime, been using this to pay my bills. but for some unknown reason i cannot use this app for a couple of days now, all i have is the uninstall option and it takes forever to uninstall the app. i tried rebooting my phone as well but to no avail. please resolve this issue.","254941":"Nowadays, when I'm doing transactions thru the GCash App the loading time is longer than the usual. It's inconvenient as you'll really need to spend time waiting for the options to show up especially when you're like buying a load or paying your bills.","255228":"I'm giving this two stars because why I can't verify my account using my Student ID? Which in fact it is in the recommended section we're we can use it to verify the account but when I click the \"fully verify\" the Student ID was not in the choices. Please fix this!!! I want to earn money through loading. I'll just edit this review if you fix it already.","255365":"I CAN'T LOG IN TO MY ACCOUNT","255731":"Cash in, money but it did not reflect on my balance but it was succesfully sent to their system as per banks confirmation. It was really an inconvenience since the app did not as it was supposed to. It is money for my medicine and food. So disapponited","255806":"So irritating to always have it updated to latest version. Like every month or something? How about try to upgrade it and we can use it for 6months? Just by that it can't make us inconvenient to use.","256105":"From time to time it is asking to update otherwise it wont open I do not like the update because it will ask to delete some apps when storage is not enough . Update should only be asked once a year not everytime. Please refrain from update this app. \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20","256300":"This is a good app! I hope so?

Is it ok to reinstall this app? Does we can recover our info details?","256913":"Poor service. Too many ads and the fee is no longer equivalent to the utility I am getting. Too much bugs. Too many updates and poor customer service.","257736":"This is a very useful app for people just like me who are very busy everyday and do not have luxury of time to fall in line inside the bank everytime. It is very convenient for me. I don't need to bring cash mostly all the time even for getting gasoline for my car at Shell and Seaoil I can also use it. I hope they can get more merchants to join them so I can be totally cashless all the time. Hope there will be more business development and app development as well.","257747":"Good services. It's less hassle activity and have other ways to use money online. With this GCash, I have less worries especially most of the time I'm paying some orders or sending money. I also had a gcash mastercard and I was able to withdraw from atm but why is the fee high compared to traditional bank's debit card? Usually the fees of the debit card of the traditional bank is between 5-12 pesos depending on prestigious banks while in e-wallet money costs 18 pesos. Can this be explain pls?","257830":"What happened to the Gsave section always in rhe maintenance.","258402":"Tha app makes a lot of transactions easier. Yes, there are bugs and ads, but they're always part of any mobile app. As long as it serves its purpose, all good for me. \ud83d\ude42","259030":"Convenient but too much update. For the second time the app ask me to update before using it again and I was in the counter that time! So make it optional because sometimes the only update is the design!","259283":"Too many updates & upgrades.. I'm freaking sick of updating.. Another thing is there is already a fee for remittance and so on..","259302":"Poor app, and even connection broadband or mobile data, poor customer service,,,,unable to supply the needs of consumer...","259376":"Too many updates and yet there's no changes on the app. And apps are getting too annoying since there is so many of them.","259629":"Such a useful app and I really love it! I am a fully verified GCash user so it allows me to get my money real time, pay bills online and buy load at my convenience! There was a time that I got an issue with the app and I couldn't find any way to fix it so I call their support for a help (take note 'call', not helpful to contact them through chat). They gave me a very effective trouble shooting tip. It is really awesome to get my account working back as how it used to! 5 stars! Thanks!","260009":"Its so much annoying ,too many updates ,what if we dont have a data we cannot open the apps to buy load in gcash because its need to update again and again i think every week if im not mistaken your asking to updates your apps ,please do me a favor make your apps update atleast once a month not every second we open your apps your asking again to updates tsk tsk\ud83d\ude44","260846":"Too much update. It's annoying. Everytime I open the app.","262255":"Keeps asking for update and when I update it, a retry button appears so I have to uninstall and re-install from time to time. I also used it once in purchasing online which costs Php249 and I received a notification message that I'm purchasing online with that amount and needed to confirm it in my gcash which I did. After few minutes Php49 has been deducted to my gcash account without receiving any notification and no confirmation was done. I didn't do that online transaction yet I was deducted.","262984":"Good app but too many updates which is both good and bad. Bad because time consuming, good because it will be more convenient.","263325":"I want to load my family number but the app sometimes don't have a tm or globe product to choose.

Very inconvenient!","264073":"why can't i buy load for globe now. i hope you can fix this asap. and i hope when you do an update make it optional. so we can still open and use the app. its frustrating when you run out of load and data and you can't open the app unless we update it. i have to go outside just to buy for load . so inconvenient. i thought this app was made for convenience .tsss","264217":"Too many updates it is inconvenient when you run out of load.

I can pay whenever and whatever day and time. Cashless transactions had made me so easy, by ordering foods,items onlines ,through paying bills.

When loading, the telco menu changes and doesn't include globe. 2 weeks ago, the link to phone contacts did not work in the Buy Load section. This version has quite a number of flaws from the last version","267403":"The frequancy of updates is annoying. With every shopping season comes a new update just to change up the UI. Its ruining my UX especially the updates coincides with me being outside or my memory is full and i'm in need of a quick transaction. User experience is far more important than the interference.","267774":"I hope that they upgrade their poor customer service system. I submitted multiple tickets even sent several emails but all I got was an automated reply from their horrible chatbots. The reply was just repeated even though my concerns and question were different.","267979":"The app is good in terms of transactions, so convenient. However, I'm giving this a 1 star because the release of the energies earned through transactions in GFOREST is not real time. Also the notification was removed so everytime I check if the energies are credited, it is already gathered by other user.","268975":"i definitely think there's been a lot of improvement with the app's functionality lately. i may be nitpicking but it still lags sometimes, although it is definitely offset by the fact that it no longer crashes on me. i now enjoy using the app more, and it no longer feels like a chore just getting its features to work smoothly.","269136":"Your support sucks, at first they will say I have problems in my photos having a glare or having beautification mode on, even if it is turned off along side ai mode.\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12 now they were encouraging me to go to villiarica location\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 it is a hassle since it is far away from my home and, very risky to travel just for a verification on your app, this app is built for convenience yet your acct verification sucks and doesn't cater School Id, specially some student's transaction needs.","269617":"\"I can't log in because of late sms code\"","269887":"I was disappointed by how the customer service handled my complaint. My gcredit was downgraded and I said that I really need that for paying my bills. And that lately I could not use the app because of technical issues or upgrades. But they still insisted to use gcash more frequently. I replied to them that didn't you read my email. Such disappointment.","270012":"This is a good app coz it is convenient however, if transactions were done more than 24 hours ago, this does not show the transactions in the app. I tried to send the transactions then to my email since there is an icon that does so, but up until now there is no email from them. Frustrating","270037":"Very useful and convenient in paying bills and bank transfer, the problem is so limited credit limit to each user, Sana dagdagan nyo po kahit 20k per user Ang limit... TIA","270090":"The otp that you are giving is so delayed that you have to ask for another and then another but the system do not accept it.

In terms like this where people was in their difficult times because of the typhoon instead of helping your customers you're giving them more problems.","270204":"Should have given a 0 star rating for giving false information! The app requires Android 4.0 or up and I am using 9.0 on my device but it says its not compatible. I was able to install it a copied apk and able to do a few transactions then a few days after it keeps on crashing saying it needs to update but after the update the app just keep on crashing! You should change whoever is in charge of your development having unable to resolve issues where other financial apps had none. Is this a way to FORCE your customer to BUY new \"compatible\" mobile phones from you? I have been using Globe for 20yrs maybe it is time to change a new telco?","270375":"Verification process is awful. For example when you press an arrow to pick options on a certain type like Nature of Work it only flashes the title \"Nature of Work\" nothing else where are the options to choose why theres only the title???!!!","270445":"Your customer support sucks big time! We've been trying to access our account for more than a month now. You kept sending us emails and we kept on explaining even proactively providing the necessary things for your reference and verification, still, you kept replying us with emails that doesn't even help! I highly suggest you establish your own customer support where we can TALK to a LIVE AGENT. Do you have any idea how much of a hassle you are putting us in? Convenient indeed!","270941":"This app is very time consuming. There are three steps for the verification process. To begin with, I have to take a photo of any preferred ID, however, I tried to do it over and over again cos \"no internet connection\" keeps popping up. Additionally, I have to take a photo of myself, but after doing it, the whole app crashes. Furthermore, I have to fill up the form but again not working, for instance when I click the Nationality there are no choices, how can I choose then? So frustrating.","271146":"This application is useful and easy to use for any transactions. but why you always send me of my payment to Google? i don't have any transaction to Google! they tried to charge me 1,500. they said that my payment to Google has been unsuccessful due to insufficient balance & remaining credit limit. And they want me to click the link to top-up my wallet..","271161":"Bumili ako ng e-pin thru your app kasi need ko sa event ng game ko. I was deducted and received confirmation but the E-PIN NEVER ARRIVED. The game event starts Dec 21 and will end Dec 26.. But still no action. Your escalation team SUCKS..

It goes back to help page over and over like nothing happened. It is frustrating as my money didn't reflect back on my Gsave account and no notifications received.","271713":"Update nang update. Please give us update as an option, just like software updates of OS and security patches in android as option only, don't force us to update if we can't or don't want. Have you seen android unusable if not updated? Not yet right? So what gives?","271896":"A very great and convenient app, specially allowing you to by pass in google play in paying game stuff and other payment system, I really like the bank transfer and billing option which is quick and reliable, but now the app is bloated with ads and unnecessary updates to bloat it with ads worst than the Globe wifi app which is unnecessary to use when loading.","272083":"Any help resolving issues about returning the money is always labelled solved when It wasn't. Either bec it was sent to another number or the money credited back by the bank when their ATM did not dispense cash using my gcash c\u00e0rd. It's almost a year including money wrong sent With the other party willing to accommodate but Gcash won't credit or back. The gcash Help Center is the most \"unhelpful\" customer service I've encountered. Imconpetents!","272132":"So many glitches especially when you need it most. Please have the app send notifs in advance for maintenance activity. Whether for the whole app or for specific functions (GSave, GInvest, etc.) This is the biggest inconvenience of the app right now.","272380":"It's really a reliable apps where ever you go where ever you are, I love using this app especially when receiving and cash out money it so easy and will not give you hassle time ,I recommend this to anyone , it's my wallet for a year","272625":"I already request for otp code many times for log in and I entered it all correctly , but the problem it says that there is something wrong and I need submit a ticket.. and when I submit the ticket and follow all the said steps that I need to do there's no changes at all .. still I cannot log in my gcash\ud83e\udd7a I don't know where to get help. I sent an email again and there's to help from staff \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a","272632":"Very incompetent supports and useless policy. The hassle of being reasked to edit a mistake I didn't do several times, already waited for 2 months for the approval of that mistake which IS AN ERROR ON THEIR END TO BEGIN WITH, and yet the feedback I got after 1460 hours is to reapply for updating of account details. Really Gcash? Just how incompetent can you all be?!","272766":"It's a great apps but I am on the last steps of verifying my gcash account and I'm still stuck on it because I can't type or choose the informations that is required and needed. Our internet wifi is strong and I don't know what's wrong. Please do something about it because I know that I am not the only one who encountered it. There are others who experienced it. Please do something so that my gcash account will be fully verified. Thank you so much.","272964":"I'm so disappointed with the service. I'm having issues accessing my account for several weeks and I have money that I need to use in it. It ask me to submit a ticket which I did and will get back to me after 24hrs it's been a week and still no update! It's frustrating!","273291":"I can't verify myself. The ID picture is okay, the photo of myself is okay then when it comes to filling up my infos nothing pop out and I can't fill it up. It kinda lags too unfortunately. But it's convenient so please fix some bugs that you have.","273302":"So far, this is the most convenient savings app for me. I also use this to oay bills and shop. I hope you fix the issue of the app going back to default categories every after updates. I hate that I have to arrange again and again every after maintenance and updates. But aside from that this is great.","273916":"Convinient, yes. But if you have no valid ID listed for ONLINE verification, you will have struggles on verifying it OFFLINE. The FAQs and the ticket didn't help either as it will only e-mail you a reply over the general FAQ which doesn't even cover up your problem. Quite disappointed over there since my available ID is listed on the Offline verification and they don't have a list of stores where I can submit it to apply.","273971":"I know it's convenient, however, sometimes its frustrating, like why did the update removed my list of billers? When paying bills, why is it asking me to retry in 60 minutes, i know it failed because of an invalid account name the first time, why wait for 60 mins, when i made corrections?","274168":"Works fine the last 2 weeks but this week I could no longer log-in to my account, I tried to send a ticket and tried uninstall then reinstall but the app still won't let me log in to my account and I can't see follow-ups on the tickets I send because I needed to log-in on the app to see it. Disappointed.","274375":"When I tried to verify my profile so I could use it for my transaction and then I scanned my National ID, it always said that my picture is BLURRY even though it is CLEAR and READABLE. I adjust the light of my camera and it is still the same pop-up. Fix this! It's getting me into my nerves, so FRUSTRATING.","274581":"Poor service and app. I am always having problem signing in to my account, so many glitches\/bugs. I always get \" temporarily unavailable\" more often than not. Its not convenient to use!!!!","274949":"If I can give zero rating to this I would. You can never trust gcash whenever you need it the most. When you buy load, no confirmation is received,when you buy E-pins no pins received. And when you submit a ticket for this issue, your concern will be addressed after 2-3days. How timely isn't it? And they will say, they will refund your cash and then you will received an email saying the pin has been sent to you after a week or two. Great right? How timely and responsive CS. Pure BS.","274987":"Overall, great app to use when going out. Very convenient when it comes to making payments in stores or paying bills. However there are lots of unexpected maintenance and unavailability when it comes to loading. This is so frustrating since sometimes when i need urgent load, it would be unavailable and Gcash doesnt even let you know in advance, send you a message that loading are unavailable, nothing!","275059":"I can't verify my account. Back when they have the \"Other IDs\" option in verifying your account, i tried to verify mine using my school ID a couple of times and it wouldn't work. I think that it is very inconvenient for people to go to the nearest Villarica Pawnshop if their valid ID isn't included in the list of valid IDs that Gcash accepts","275331":"This app could have been helpful, it is easy to use but there has been a lot of issues going on with this app. I use Gcash to withdraw funds from paypal and transact online. But one time when I cashed in using their app, there was no confirmation and the amount did not appear at all. Paypal completed the transfer so it has been an issue with Gcash. I even received a text message about their app having issues. First they asked me to wait for 24 hours, then to 48 hours and now they are asking for","275375":"Can't even login in the app before this problem happen I was verifying my GCash account I was trying to put all my information but the app would not even make write stuff after a while the app denies my entry after puting my phone number and typing the OTP code an error pops out it tells me to submit a ticket I did send a ticket and follow some instruction to fix the problem but the error persist I can't even check the ticket that I've submit because I need to login no customer service!!!","275833":"Used to be an ok app. Filed a ticket to resolve an issue (successful fund transfer from originating bank but money did not appear in gcash) but there was no response. So i called Landbank. Luckily, Landbank was so prompt and helpful so the funds I have transfered to gcash was reverted to landbank. Now, it's inconvenient because i have to go out to cash-in. Also, it is difficult to link gcash with apple.","275862":"There seems to be a problem on your verification process. The selection options in \"fill informations\" are not working. I've tried it to multiple phones but still not working.","275984":"About the verification, the face scan, I am not very satisfied. I did to have a good lighting, nice background but still it didn't work I even used all my attempts to verify my account because of that problem until now I am not yet verified!! You better make an update to the app!!","276300":"Android Version is not so good with send money with ease. my phone book does not show up and all my saved or favorites like the people i usually send money to does not appear or the contact name and profile pic is not shown. While the iOs version has limited or does not permit to put message in options esp if the version is higher or not upgraded\/updated.","276453":"Slowly becoming like trash. Security is low, you just need to enter a 4 digit pin. Should've been better if there is a confirmation text message before logging in. Update sucks! Everytime it updates, it deletes all of my saved favorite transactions like shortcuts. I need to enter all details again whenever I want to give LOAD to someone. Before, there was a FAVORITES option that will save all the details so it's not troublesome on the next time you transact.","276484":"Poor customer service as they answered emails via autoreply! I already wired money to gcash account and can't do anything aside from buying load as my verification process is still pending for almost 3 months now! I can't even transfer back the money into my bank account because of that! They are not helpful at all.","276583":"It's convenient for paying yes but the app is always down especially when I need to transfer and takes hours. Also their customer service sucks to be honest. My bf and I has filed some issues since last year and they didn't even bother to resolve it. And now I didn't receive my money after cashing in via PayPal and still no resolution.","276703":"Very disappointing customer service. Even worse than the customer service of Lazada. Had to suspend my account when I lost my phone. Since I was able to retrieve my old number, I requested for the suspension of my account to be lifted. Submitted all the documents they asked right away buts its been 10 days and they still wasn't able to resolve my concern. Poor customer service.","277280":"This app is very tiring, I install again and again because it keeps on stopping. They dont even send the OTP pin when I already requested it many times, I even used two mobile numbers but they haven't sent anything. I also cannot login to my account even thought it logged out on its own, Its frustrating especially you really needed it,","277413":"I'm so disappointed with this app and it's customer service, until now my account is not verified, they alway says that they will do their best to accomodate my request within 7 days, but it is almost a month since i downloaded this app and try to verify it. I badly needed my gcash account, but the developer and its team are irresponsible.","277430":"I was DEDUCTED TWICE when I sent money. I raised my concern and submitted a ticket, but they are saying that I purposely sent the money twice with the exact same amount. I sent money at 1:22:32PM, then gcash deducted it again at 1:22:42PM. Having a 10 SECOND INTERVAL, and now they are telling me that i just really sent it twice. Considering the 10second interval, how would that be possible knowing that gcash is full of lags and bugs? POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.","277463":"Verification takes too long. Di nag sesend ng update sa process of verification which is very frustrating. Will change this once I'm already verified.","277630":"It was a good app to be used when paying bills, but unlike before after the update it become more difficult to be verified user. There's too much process, I mean I think to be verified as long as it is the owners ID it should be fine. Applying for verification using student ID is not included in the new update and it was dissapointing a bit.","277700":"This app really sucks. Struggle is real in verification process. Information that was already process should be saved before going to the next step. Once you were not able to complete it, it will go back to the first step which is totally a hassle going through the process again.","277753":"The verification process. I'm still not verified. I took a lot of pictures of my ID yet it comes out as unclear because the photo ID needs to be clear and readable, even though I took it to different lightings. The pictures seem clear for me but not for the app. I wished that it had an upload photo option so that I don't have to take several pictures of our IDs and it comes out as unclear for the app. PLEASE FIX THIS. I REALLY NEED THIS APP BECAUSE I HAVE A PAYMENT TO MAKE AS IT HAS A DEADLINE.","277991":"Convenient at first but after the 90-day auth, reaccessing the app seems difficult. Just like today, asking for OTP takes time to get only one (worse case-none). No text. No notif...nothing. Now i'm stuck on the limbo right now while waiting for the OTP number to receive on my mobile. EDIT: they said they forward the issue on Investigations team and i am alreay waiting for 20 DAYS since January 12.","278326":"I have had no problems using this app so far. My account got automatically deactivated at one point because my sim expired, but I had no trouble creating a new one and getting help to move my funds there. It took maybe about a week, so perhaps this part of the process could use a little improvement. Overall, it's a very functional app.","278494":"I have been trying to get my account verified but every time I will be routed to the third part which is fill information it doesn't work at all! It doesn't allow me to fill in the information that needed crazy!. Fix this as soon as possible pls!","278553":"Never ending 7 days verification... i submitted the requirements, weeks ago... up until now its verification in progress... submitted ticket for the concern. 1 ticket takes 7 days to say log in app to complete verification. But no change at all it still says verification in progress.","278761":"It's a good app when it works. I dislike the fact that it tends to be slow. The experience isn't that smooth too. Those things could be improved. Still, thanks for developing the app!","279019":"The buy load system is so slow, we've been losing customers because sometimes it wouldn't even load at all! It's not because of our phone nor our internet, we've tested it with our friends too but it's still so slow. Please fix the buy load system and make it faster, we are fully verified and this is what we get?","279167":"It's getting worse!!! I once again couldn't get teh salary my company deposited on gsave! Your gsave is really suck!!! You will lose more users with your poor service!!","280103":"Useless. Impossible to register your identity and bank account information. Unintalled it. Tried again and was able to add cash by loading the account at 7-11. Was able to use it a couple of times. Now I am unable to login to my account and use the funds I deposited. They say they will get back to me in 24 hours. Not very useful if you need to use the funds now. I would give it a negative review if I could, since they have effectively stranded my assets. Fraud comes to mind.","280193":"I can't get verified no matter how many times I tried even when the photo is so clear and readable. It's pissing me off it's been 3 days and I still haven't get verified because every time I submit the photo it always says that it's unclear when in fact it's as clear as the sky and readable.","280443":"Maintenance update notifs are sent late or are not sent at all. Inconsistent usability between Android and iOS. It's also like the system did not undergo thorough testing. Customer service agents are often helpful but take too long to respond and sometimes feel like they do not understand the concern at all.","280708":"Well, this app always unavailable in times when you need it the most.\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e keeps on fixing something blah blah blah \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e. Also globe signal reception is poor. I guess it wouldn't hurt if you add more cell tower to make your signal reception even more better to give good service to your clients and subscribers. Because of that uhm im giving -5 ka na sa langit. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e","281276":"Great App been using it for 3 years now. I only have one suggestion can you please add a feature where we can still use our Gcash account, manage our funds, and change our Gcash phone number by logging in using our registered email. Just in case our cellphone or sim got lost so no more hassle on getting new sim with the same number since there's many requirements needed. With the email option everything will be seamless since your platform have tons of features now.","281543":"I made an online transaction for in game credits, the money was deducted from my acct and said it was succesful however i didn't receive the in game credits in my Acct. I always make transactions like these but since your update it there are now a few errors, Tang ina sayang 250 ko","281577":"I used to like the app.Now, i seriously think their service have declined.There's too many maintenance time, without prior notice, which is a bummer considering its the most used fintech\/EMI. Some features also undergo maintenance quite a lot (Gsave).The customer service is so poor.They give out generic answers that do not address the issue at all , then resolve the ticket. Gives you the impression that they don't value their users. In grab, you can chat agents and they really address issue.","281606":"I had to submit a ticket after at least seven days of my GSave application to find out that my reverification was not successful and I would have never known that if I did not even raise my concern in the first place. The reason was that they no longer accept the valid ID that I used even though it was still on the list given when you try to reverify (they have an updated the list but it's not yet reflected on the app). Customer service replies also seem way too auto-generated.","282646":"This is zero rating. Always automated response about the tickets. No actions are being done. might as well delete this app, It is useless anymore. Just verification process is disappointing enough and I still have money left inside my account. Very poor service. I recommend to switch E-wallets nalamg guys. Gcash is a scam and useless anymore","283090":"Send money is not working. I dont received any authentication code since yesterday and today. I cannot pay my supplier using my gcash send money transaction. Did all the troubleshooting but still the same problem. No chat support available. No one is fixing the issue via help & ticket .","283147":"Gcash Dev. I think there's a bug on your QR Code scan feature when paying. It is not snappy as it used to be. I've been encountering this error for couple of months now. It is throwing some error. Paymaya is fast as hell when scanning the QR Code. I have to open a new account to Paymaya just because of this issue. Hopefully, you fixed it soon.","283242":"I have a very hard time in verification process because of the first step where I have to take a picture of my valid ID and it's so frustrating because it keeps on telling me that it is unclear and unreadable even though IT IS VERY CLEAR AND READABLE and I keep on doing it a multiple times but it still can't telling me that it's blurred.","283601":"Where's the OTP? As this app is only good for 95 days, one has to register again and there's a promised OTP to reactivate but never received. Resubmission for an OTP makes the app stuck at that screen as no OTP is received.","283617":"I'll still give 5 star. Although i was a bit disappointed with my gscore and gcredit \ud83d\ude25. My problem is why my gscore sometimes it goes up but more often it goes down.. Even if i used it still the same .. ups then down.i would have liked to increase my cl in the gcredit but always like that..

Cant use the funds that I have to complete important transaction. Very frustrating","284225":"The constant update is stressing me out. I love using GCash because of its easy and convenience transaction methods but these days, especially today, I find it really stressful because I cannot even get a proper OTP.","284392":"Update: No major issues with the app. Really useful. But the customer service is still poor. I just dont have much issues so i dont have anything to report. (Read a lot of review. Very poor customer service. Automated response and deleted\/closed my ticket without much help. Even the app says that you can fully verified now your account, it just fails 'System Error'. No help at all. Still quite convenient, i dont need to go outside to buy load and pay bills. But cons are greater than pros.)","284447":"Dumb! I've waited more than an hours just to receive the freakin' code so I can log in my freakin' old account but it turns out it's no use the code didn't send. What a freak!!!

And FYI my internet here is absolutely good so it's not the Internet's fault that the code didn't receive.","284460":"Very usefull apps, easy way for any transaction like bills payment, transfer money etc. But, when troubles come in any transaction they cannot accomodate you or assist you in a short days. Just like my experience, I withdraw cash at the ATM using my G-cash Master Card, the ATM cancelled my transaction but my credit on Gcash are lost. I've try to reach GHelp Center, but it always the same messages sent to my email that they escalated my concern but it is now more than 1 week past stil no action.","284510":"This app used to be fine and almost perfect but not anymore with those recent buggy updates.. the incorrect authentication error, despite correctly entered, causes a double withdrawal in my gsave account but only made one deposit in my gcash after i requested for another authentication code.. good thing i noticed it and complained to a customer service.. im worried my money became unsafe here.","286059":"rated it 2 stars before, but is now loving the app after they respond to my concern and resolved it,so I am giving it 4 stars.Might be adding another star in the future if the app continues to impress me.","286428":"After the initial issue, this app is now working great. Well, aside from the multiple system updates and down time. I use this for my savings and investment. Also for bills payments and for sending money to friends.","286629":"Very easy to use.. sometimes it says transactions cannot be process ..never mind about it specially when you need to do payments right away it is only that your signal is not stable ... All in all it is great ..I hope you are reliable til the end of time","286763":"I would have given this a 5 star if only my gscore is being increased nor decreased accordingly.

Because I'd experience twice withdrawing in my gsave but due to bad signal may withdrawal didn't reflect in the gcash wallet.

Also sometimes I can't access gcash in my phone play store it keep saying try again latter even though my internet is great","292655":"Very poor customer service. My account was deactivated for unknown reasons. I reported these concerns immediately. Until now, no proper actions that was made.

Its good now","296797":"There are a lot of people who are \"gcash verifiers\" on facebook and they offer \"trainings\".

I have submitted several tickets and GCash Support told me to login to the app to proceed to validate completion of my account but how could I when it is in \"upgrade in progress\"? Then they would say the tickets I submitted have been solved?! I am so disgusted and have been so inconvenienced! I just want to get my money back!","297863":"Really. The app is so frustrating. It won't work when you needed it most. Even customer support is frustrating. I cant verify my mom's account,so I sent a ticket and was told,that I should change device. so I did. I tried it on my phone and lo and behold I cant log out my account to log in my mom's. FRUSTRATING","298150":"The submit a ticket option is absolutely useless because GCash team doesn't find a way to solve the problems but it automatically say \"Solved\" even it's \"NOT SOLVED\". The verification process sucks! If you won't accept our application, give us an update and let us resubmit a new application instead. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! I WILL RATE THIS 0 STAR. IF THERE WILL BE OPTION FOR 0 STAR.\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e Shopee's customer service is way better because it provide real agents! Please fix your system GCash!","298946":"Verification last time only took a few minutes, and now verification is still \"upgrade in progress\" for like a month now. Tried sending a ticket and waited then I get a \"solved\" status, didn't really solve much of my concern. Tried sending for the second time and still got that auto generated email. Customer service is very poor, some instructions in the app were not even clarified to users, sending a ticket also seems to have no good outcome at all. This app still needs a lot of improvement.","299276":"This app helped me a lot. It's so easy to use and is very convenient especially when sending money. Unlike atm cards where you have to look for atm machines and or go directly to the bank, with gcash app, Cash in and cash out transactions can be done from many stores near you and what's more interesting is that some stores don't require payments for cash in. I gave a 4 star rate hoping for more helpful updates. For my recommendation, it would be better if this app works without consuming data.","299401":"I'm gonna edit my review. it's better now than last time","299817":"I've been trying to get verified since last year and it always say \"upgrade in progress\" I submitted tickets numerous times but still not resolved. And their gigi isn't even helpful at all. Useless. I am getting impatient of this app since it takes so long for them to solve issues. Can't even speak with a live representative to address the issue\/problem. Worst customer service!!!","300000":"I've been updating since yesterday but until now NO improvement. Its not about the signal because I was able to update the software of my phone last night at the same time. But your app its very hard to update. Next time you advise for a need to update atleast days before not on the time it is needed to be used. I still have remaining amount in my Gcash but I can't use since yesterday because your App is asking for update but still updating doesnt work out. Is it a SCAM?","300381":"Had horrible experience with their service. Extremely hard to verify your account and services are very limited even for long-time users. The app keeps having issues, and with the recent update it's no longer compatible with my device. Good riddance.","300480":"I transferred funds from payoneer to gcash. On my previous experiences, the transfers were real time. All transaction were smooth. Not until this recent one. My payoneer has zero balance and got a confirmation number that funds were transferred to my local bank, which is the gcash. Right after that incident, I submitted a complaint\/ticket. As of this writing, I have not received any response, it's almost 48 hours already. No calls, no emails. Can't reach their customer service number (2882).","300505":"It's a good app for cashless payment, both for purchases and receiving cash. But, so frustrating to see too many updates and ads insertion ,causing delays and too much data charges, memory capacity in phone.","301007":"I am finally verified, thank you for resolving the issue, thank you very much GCash! 5 stars","301498":"I can't verify my ID because of how bad the quality of the photo taken out in the app. When I use my phoney camera, the image is fine. I've noticed that the app uses one camera to take a ID photo while most phones today has more than one camera. I hope you will fix this. I'm having a hard time using it.","301722":"Upon filling information, I tap on the blanks, but they won't let me enter data, not even a single character; it just shows me the blank's label like for an example: I tap on the blank under the \"Nationality\" label, but instead of the screen showing me the keyboard, the screen only shows me the \"NATIONALITY\" label itself as if I can't read it clearly without magnifying it first. The system says informations can't be blank and yet the system won't let me fill them up. What should I do now???","301854":"This app has many bugs. For example; logging in to send a ticket. If you log in you cannot attach anything such as ID or error messages. If you don't log into your account you can attach ID and error codes. And the instructions that GCash sends out are all outdated and don't work on the new versions. Trying to look at your open tickets they never are available and then GCash clears them out because you don't comment on them. On paper it looks like they are doing a fantastic support job. NOT","301877":"This app really helps me alot in terms of money transfer.. I dont have any issues in terms of upgrading my account, tjere is just one thing I noticed.. If you dont have a load balance it can only be accessible on globe or tm sim cards, hope it can also be accessible if you are a smary or tnt user even w\/o load balance, aside from that everything was cool and good..","302113":"1 star for now because of the new feature where you need to get an authentication code for every transaction. It's really annoying because I don't receive any authentication code. whenever I try to express send someone I don't receive any authentication code. now I can't really use the money. it's really really really annoying and please remove it because it's not helpful and it just get things more complicated \ud83d\ude11","302152":"The verification process sucks. It's always saying that the picture is unclear when in fact, the photo taker on the app makes the picture blurry. When I took a photo through my phone, the photo was high quality. I recommend that you should put an option to upload photos from the gallery & consider the landscape photo to better capture a higher quality of pictures. The system is always down as well, making me repeat to take a photo w\/c is really annoying Lastly, the customer service is useless.","302372":"this app always updating. incase of emergency you can't do anything but to wait until the app will work again properly. it's very inconvenient. if this app will always update i'll change my app to coins.ph.. how many times do i need to sent a request for otp before i will recieved?","302908":"Reviewed it as 2 stars before but decided it somewhat improved but I still find it irritating that they have long downtimes during the wee hours in the morning. For work at home people, this is an inconvenience as you cant use the service to purchase or order online. Shorten your maintenance at night. Hopefully. Never put your eggs in one basket. Its still not dependable enough.","302980":"It's easy to get assistance when you encountered errors. Thanks for promptly assisting me with my concern.","303478":"Gcash has been a very convenient thing to me in terms of payments and other transactions as well. So far, the new version of these app is very unsatisfy such as 'Buying loads'. Compared to the downgrade version i can pick the desired amount that i want to purchase, unlike now there is only a 'fixed' amount. In addition to that, its a hassle thing to look for a specific promos or load that i like to purchase. There is no 'Search Bar' anymore. Hope i could get your attention and address this issue","303690":"For a couple of weeks or months of using this app. This is the very first time that I've encountered an issue. The application is not sending OTP to the phone and that's a big downside of this app because I can't transact to others just because of that fail system. I've done restarting and updating my phone. I've done uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I've done clicking airplane mode and sending code to my telenetwork just to wait for the OTP and there's nothing. Please update us for that.","305265":"I like this GCash app because I use this to buy load and pay my bills. However, I'm having a hard time with my verification process for months now. I did send a ticket a few times now but whenever I try to validate my verification request, I keep on clicking the list of valid ID but it would not allow me to proceed. I hope you can fix this. Thank you so much!","306148":"This app has been causing so much inconvenience. And it's the second time I experienced not receiving the money I transferred to bank. What's worse, It's taken longer this time. I transferred last April 1 and no updates.","306157":"This app has so many issues. It's always a hard time logging in, you have to input your MPIN several times, the processing dialog box keeps popping out but always fails to connect. Even when you're having in app transactions. I've been using GCash for 5 years now but this app became difficult to use and it's such a hassle. Very frustrating.","306512":"The most useful app ever. I can do things without even going out and it is very convenient. I hope thi app can be used even with free data. Thanks to the developer. Keep it up, there's many room for improvement but I am really satisfied with the app.","306939":"I lost 150 pesos for buying load that wasn't received by the recipient, I submit tickets regarding to this problem but there's still no action with this matter it's been 3 days already. There's a lot of issues when the gcash started updating their app!","307109":"The only thing functional here is loading a mobile number. Always offline when cashing in, always under maintenance, can't send money. Edit: significantly improved services since last review posted. Changing from 1 star to 4 star. Would have given 5 stars but there were a lot of maintenance recently especially on payday that the services are needed.","307147":"poor customer service. help desk always sent me to send requirements over and over. already sent them 4 times and still the same. 5 days na di pa din fully verified samantalang before it only took 15mins to get fully verified.","307317":"Been using the app for almost 2 years and It's very useful and convenient for me. Though sometimes their seems to be a problem but still the reaponse for the repair is very quick .I hope this app continue to be as good as it is now and deliver a good service for all the users.Thank you.","307575":"With the recent update, the app is more useful and convenient moat especially in your online money transactions","308494":"I agree with the one who wrote a review about sending money to others should also be available to unverified accounts since there is an OTP before the transaction for security purposes; while cash out should be available online to users who underwent KYC or verification process. Gcash users especially the students find it hard to verify their accounts since getting a valid ID is not simple. Looking forward to seeing an impressive development.","309900":"I wish I could use this even without mobile data. I had to buy a load sometimes just to open it and pay my bills. I once had to experience a panic attack paying my bill at pure gold because I realized just then I have no cash with me. The cashier was waiting for me to pay and the people falling in line next to me were also troubled.","310347":"It takes too long to send the OTP or worst, it just doesn't send. It's very inconvenient during times that we're in a hurry. I have to wait 5 more minutes to input the different pins again! Then there's the verification process. It's very annoying. I have to wait another time since I had too many attempts. It says that the photo is unclear when in fact the app is the one making it poor-quality! Voters ID and SSS ID is useless even if it's valid due to the fact that it is old.","311030":"Good app but it's irritating. When you are in a hurry to use the app, it will require you to update first. You're a slave on this app. You cannot do anything but follow!","311045":"please don't force users to update the app before using it as it may be used in a rush, quick reload, during emergencies or by people needing this app but with limited data balance or network connection. updating before using the app is a big HASSLE. ADD A \"SKIP\" BUTTON FOR UPDATE NOTIFS!!","316338":"It's been almost a month since I apply for account verification. I reported a ticket twice but they kept on saying to wait for seven days. Now it's almost a month but the status of verification is \"upgrade in progress\". The first ticket for the problem I reported got \"solved\" status in the app even though it is not really solved. Poor customer service.","316957":"I dont remember registering my second phone number but the app seems to imply that I have it registered. I dont know the MPIN and when I try to retrieved it (even though I don't know it was registered), I can't get through the security questions. I can't even talk to a live person about it. They only have the bot which does not even help. This is so frustrating.","317064":"Costumer service sucks. Had a problem with my gcredit where they automatically deduct the amount but since my balance was not enough that time they deducted, they automatically sent me a message that I accured a penalty without the due date ending yet. I paid the full amount that same day but they still charged me with the penalty. Took days before my ticket was responded and they just marked it as solved without considering my problem. Even telling me that my due date was on the past day.","318063":"It has been over 2 months since I applied for a verification upgrade status yet it is still not verified. Tried submitting countless of tickets but the response has always been the same. It's so annoying because the agent is the one who told me to just create another account since the number that I used for my previous account got expired and now the process of upgrading to new one is so hassle. Very bad customer service.","318182":"The app is good but I do feel that it needs some improvement like when you buy load the receipt that you get in the app doesn't indicate the number of receiver and I find it useless that you still need to rely in text messages just to confirm that your load is being bought and you don't need to look and wait for the text message of your load transaction.","319005":"It's so annoying! Why I can't register on this app?! Everytime I fill up the registration it's always seeing me like \"something went wrong, submit a ticket\" then after submitting the ticket there's nothing change in that? There's too many issues! Not only 5 times I register on it but several times!!! when I really need it, your system is still different here. we need a lot. it doesn't make sense for us to install it if you don't fix it right away! many have lost money because of your system. Yo","323608":"Right now, whenever i buy load the app just go back to the main menu. Please fix this. I'm using Redmi Note 10 5G. Edit: it's the contact number menu that's not working. You have to write the phone number instead to make the buy load work. I'll just 3 star this. Fix this issue. Edit: Just when i got used to your \"new\" menu, you revert it back to previous setup? What were you thinking?!","323907":"Floating transactions??? Idk why some cash in transactions don't go through. It can take a long time to credit back. It's so annoying and very inconvenient. If your system is undergoing a maintenance, then we would at least appreciate getting a heads up so we won't have to use some features that are under maintenance. Otherwise, it's just poor user experience. If it wasn't for your GForest and Payoneer cash in feature, I wouldn't use GCash so often. Please fix this.","324763":"Ffs, remove the animations unnecessary for the app, remove the freaking ads on the landing page. Connecting to the \"server\" takes too damn long. Please learn basic code housekeeping. Why does everything have to suck in the Philippines? Jeeez. Update: the app is still so damn slow. Delete it or improve.","325358":"too many updates and when i try updating it, it'll say that there's something wrong with the updates andi just keep on pressing update over and over again and i still cant update this app, fix this app smh we downloaded your app and u benefited from us for it so at least make ur service at least worth downloading.","325841":"GForest in GCash lets people get indiscriminately added but won't let us remove them. Please fix this feature. It hurts our privacy. The person isn't in my contacts. One can save a number in their sim contacts and add it as a friend thru the app. When one clicks on the notification, the friend request gets automatically accepted instead of letting us view before deciding.","325882":"Stan Svt for better laugh.","326454":"Hello? I've been trying to verify my account for more than 10 times already but still I can't get pass through the 3rd stage which is the filling out of personal information. Whenever I reach that page, I can't navigate it. I can't click anything and then suddenly it goes back to the main page of my account neglecting all the processes I took.

Next year?\ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude20 oh my gosh. Another bad experience for this kind of app. And costumer service is really poor they cannot help u w\/ this kind of issues or problems.","327949":"Gsave CIMB is always updating or fixing something etc etc. I can't access my savings when i need it to withdraw.

Very poor response to the problem. I doubt they will \"SURELY\" fixed the issue.","329849":"Improved a lot","332095":"It's convenient but not totaly satisfying. too many updates and its to hassle. Hope to improve more atleast with your service without hassling to your client\/customer.","339734":"It's so annoying! The app didn't use because it needs update. The app says \"time to update\" then after updating it's not able to use again. There's always a problem with the OTP, about how many hours processing then something went wrong.

If i log in it always says that and it is very inconvenient.","340591":"It's too hard to use especially with verification! I tried so many times but it always says that the photo is too blurry when in fact, I don't have a choice since we're only allowed to use the camera in the app. I tried sending a ticket many times, too but it won't send. How can you solve this problem. Please make another way to verify like uploading the photo of the ID instead of capturing it in zolo so that it is easier to verify. I'm not the only one who is experiencing yhis problem.","340970":"I don't understand It always says there's a problem every time I log in. I deleted the app and reinstalled it multiple times.

The only reason I rated it with 1 star it's because of automated scanning of IDs when I'm about to verify. It is automatically taking a photo even though it's blurry.

It's almost 2 months and I am still not fully verified. I still can't upload my ID. Is it because I am using my National ID? Because I know people who have the same struggles with mine when fully verifying their gcash accounts using their National IDs. Do you really accept National ID as of the moment?

GCash is the main transaction today since the pandemic. More reason for you guys to step up your game. Gonna rate you 2 stars.","359473":"Worst than ever! I tried to verified my account not only once nor twice. I placed my id well, stabilize my camera to take better shot but It didn't help because the app's automatic camera sucks. It becomes blurry if not it didn't focus on my id. It is frustrating and aside from that I have to wait for a while for many attempts.","359739":"It's more responsive now with the simplified UI. I would suggest adding an optional filter for the contacts so users can save time by easily finding their favorite contacts, family members, business contacts, etc. So far, i'm beginning to like the app for it's usefulness in transacting financials. Now, if only we had faster internet in this country..","361151":"It requires certain updates most of the time that I need to make a transaction.","362134":"The new look isnt very easy on the eyes. I liked the old one better. Though the app seems to be working better. Just the whole look. Also verification takes forever with no option to resend the application. My Brother has been waiting to be verified for almost a year now.. Still no response. Ridiculous!","362706":"I've been using this app until now. I really appreciated the service of this application in times of sending and receiving money from everywhere. It serves as a convenient or an alternative for every money sender and reciever. Though sometimes it needs to be updated, it needs data to open, but I still like and trust it. Thanks for the developer of this app\ud83d\ude0a","364634":"Can you fix the problem regarding the verification process? It's really frustrating. I always get stuck in scanning the id because it's blur but when it says 'perfect' it is always followed by 'unclear photo id' then 'attempt limit reached'. The scanning quality sucks because I've been tilting phone phone countless times but it's always unfocused and blur. MY VERIFICATION REQUEST WAS NOT APPROVED 2 TIMES IN A ROW TODAY! THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING! This is the third day but still facing the samething","364839":"Services are great when they're working. Customer service isn't the best or the fastest but they do get stuff done eventually","365144":"Verification process is infuriatingly TOO slow especially for students like me. I've already went through the process several times already and submitted the verification form. I've also sent a ticket about this but received no response. It's really a huge hassle. Another thing, I can't use it if I don't update the app. Sometimes, when we go somewhere with no internet connection, I become absolutely penniless.","365511":"This app is really helpful to me since Im spending too much buying things online and it really helps! And when I need to pay somethin' I just need to open this app, but I think that this app has too many updates and u cant open it when u didnt update it. Still this is the best though, I recommend this.","365656":"Absolutely horrible support service. I have had to buy an entirely new sim as the account on my old one has been left stranded in the verification process. And now while the account on this new seem is verified, I am yet again forced to approach their attrocious team for a request to transfer funds from an even older account, and lo and behold- my ticket is again left stranded and with no progress. One will have better odds winning the lottery than seeing someone respond to your tickets...","365836":"Still unable to withdraw from CIMB for a week already! I already made reports on this but the bug fixing process is taking so long. (Edit) Gosh, I am reading all other reviews and it's mostly negative. Can the top management and Ayalas start reading customer's feedback here.","365904":"Tell me this. Why is my account didn't login. And I got my IDs that I'm trying to verify my account again. How about fix your software scanning in the ID pictures. It is just not a good software. I'll give this a 1 star if you can still manage to upload the requirements for being verifying for the account. Also the powered by thing. Yeah it's sucks. Tracking is not accurate and it just blurs all the time and forces me to do it multiple times just for verification.","366804":"Hello, I get why people is frustrated of the Verification Process. Because, you can't really do much if you don't get Verified. I tried Verifying using my School ID, it scanned and I filled my Birthdate & Other. It told me to scan my ID again so I did. But I struggled scanning it to go to the next part. But everytime I scanned it right, it just keep making me scan again!! In a loop, so PLEASE FIX THIS.","367437":"The ID scanning thingy doesn't work with my national ID. When I take pictures of my ID, it instantly says \"Perfect\" on my screen in both the front and back sides of my ID. Then, it loads and suddenly states that the images are unclear and unreadable. Due to this, I can't fully verify my account. Very inconvenient. Really frustrating.","368059":"Just a terrible app overall. SMS message from them asks me to go to \"Edit My Profile\" to submit more requirements since I am not yet 18. However after following what they said, it just prompts me back to the \"Verify Now\" page where I cant interact with anything because the verification process is pending. You literally can't be verified because there is no prompt for you to submit more requirements, and clicking \"Edit My Profile\" requires you to be verified. What????","368079":"The verification process is practically a scam. It's been almost 2 months since I applied for verification and I've emailed and submitted tickets multiple times and they keep replying with the same message. No wonder you have to process so many applications, it's because you're extremely slow! Absolutely horrendous customer service.","368152":"It's so stupid for them to just send you an email about the delays in processing the account verification when I sent them my ID and attempt at verification almost 2 months ago. My verification process has not moved forward EVER SINCE even after contacting customer support. They just send me the same thing over and over again.","368164":"Great, very useful app, but could use some consistency improvements especially on user interface and customisation. -'Buy Load' keeps changing interface -Customizing favorite features reverts back to default features that I don't need. -Delayed ad pop up is very annoying and interferes and delayes intended use.","368834":"The verification process sucks, especially when it come to ID's, at first, scanning my ID was effortless, but when it comes to the back of my ID, it says \"perfect\", then afterwards, the system lets you know that the ID is blurred, so I have to retry multiple times, until now, I cannot access the full verification because of this shenanigan!","369232":"That ID verification process using National ID is not working well. Taking a photo on the front part is surely okay but when it comes to the back, it will show that it's perfect but will give you a pop out telling to try again for the photo was blur! Tried it several times and even re-installed it again but it's useless. I even used a ticket to address the issue but they misunderstood my issue and suggested to delete my account when I am not even verified yet. Seriously, fix this please!","369547":"This updates really simplify its purpose. good job developer. \u263a","369604":"You have the worst system. I can't verify my account because it only accepts my ID photo when it's in the 'perfect' position. It also keeps on saying that my ID is unclear. I also can't use the app sometimes because it needs to be updated or no signal or for no reason at all. Instead of updating how your app looks like, fix what needs to be fixed.","370572":"This app IS VERY INCONVENIENT IN MANY WAYS! 1. It has its System Maintenance WITHOUT prior notice and for like 4-5 times a month! 2. Bank Transfers always 2-3 days delay! 3. You can Cash in easily (merchants like 7\/11 and palawan accepts cash-in) BUT you will be having hard time CASHING OUT ( as those merchants and many more gcash partners DON'T DO CASHOUTS from them)! 4. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS AVAILABLE if you need real time assistance! 5. MANY MORE to mention!","372760":"Useful App","373106":"Load functionality still works, but now you have to manually choose the network. It used to be automatic upon typing the phone number. Shows an ad half a second after it opens, sometimes tricking you to tap it when you were intending to tap something else. UI is too white. The bright light assaults the eyes when it's dark. Needs a night mode. Services have gotten more expensive and they now have a lot more competitors, but still worth having due to it being widely adopted at this point.","374331":"Do we really have to keep on updating the app. My phone is running out of data storage space. Your service is excellent, no questions about that. But the issue is time will come that we can no longer use the app because our gadgets can no longer accommodate the additional and frequent updates of the app.","375377":"The app is ok, but really? can't I use it without having to update it every now and then, like it's absolutely bothersome and makes things very inconvenient when u tryna catch somethin or in a rush. I hope that please, please let us use the app even if we dont have the latest version, updates are great but not in all cases for me, especially when Im already struggling with signal.","376796":"I feel very disappointed to this app . They can't really help you when you submit ticket . Even after you do what they want you to do to help . They dont consider for effort for one mistake in the police report that i make . Even i give all what they needed . My place is a bit far in the police . And hard now to get tricycle and also very expressive the transportation fee . Maybe its time to try other online wallet app \ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude23","377581":"The verification process is terrible. As expected, this matter has the highest number of complainants. I suggest you should change the \"powered by _____\" system. I don't know what is the accurate term for that but I believe that is the main problem. At first, I thought it was the QR at the back of PhilSys ID that keeps it on error, but as I tried other e-wallets apps like Coins.ph, I experienced the smoothest Verification process ever. You should consider this suggestions for better reviews.","378138":"Totally useful app and handy but then it is quite dissappointing for having an amount of limit to cash in to avoid % rate interest","378348":"GCash makes it convenient to do online transactions especially in the New Normal. Many thanks to the developers and co. for continuously working on this app. The 'Buy Load' feature has now been improved and takes less time to load. Great job \ud83d\udc4d","378537":"ID verification is so disappointing. I've tried verifying my account using my national id but it didn't work countless times. It says unclear photo when I'm scanning it but it's crystal clear. Never have I encountered this problem when verifying my other accounts in other platforms. It's a very complicated problem, I don't even know what's not clicking. I even tried to submit a ticket and it was useless. No one was there to help me. Hope you can fix this problem or you'll continue to lose users.","378637":"Customer services are poor, when your account is under hold. It takes a long time to unlock it. The verification process keeps repeating the same instruction which is very annoying already. Just like blurred image and images that must be really identical to the identification itself","379622":"Fix you automated picture verification system specifically for national ID. It would be better if you can choose either the option to take the picture and upload it or automatically scanned. Been dealing with this issue fix it.","380621":"That ID verification process using National ID is not working well. Taking a photo on the front part is surely okay but when it comes to the back, it will show that it's perfect but will give you a pop out telling to try again for the photo was blur!

I even used a ticket to address the issue but they misunderstood my issue and suggested to delete my account when I am not even verified yet. Put*ngina!","381050":"I hope that you may have a change number option in account. Because some of your features provided by third parties and none transferable. You made an app not user friendly. You in-courage users to use its features so that they will get higher gscore. How they will going to use it if its features conflicted in old account. Because if users need to change number they need to sign up for another new account because they don't have an option. I don't think your admin didn't know about this...","382222":"Disappointed to the ID verification system. It keeps saying that the scanned ID was blurred but it was clear and I can perfectly read the details. I received my PhilID last February, since then I kept trying to verify my account but until now it isn't verified yet beacuse of this problem. I also tried to send a ticket to the help center but no one's helping. I thought they updated their system, but I guess it was not enough.","382229":"Verification of account doesn't work. Used the specified ID but the scanning doesn't verify ID even when specific ID is up to date and NOT EXPIRED. Keeps saying that it wasn't the right one or is blurry even when it is NOT EITHER OF THE TWO. Very disappointing and I'm uninstalling said application until it gets fixed. No use using digital wallets if it doesn't let me use it.","382687":"The previous version had the game credits organized. Now, all of it is clumped together under one category. There were no complaints about the layout before, so why change it? And for the worse, at that. It's not like you have a search option so we can find what services we want to pay for. Is it so that the users have to scroll past all your other offers, potentially making them stay on the app more thus making you more money? Pretty scummy.","382728":"Always asking for an update, so frustrating","382942":"Linked card is always removed after a few days. I tried to re-add it 4 times today. I get a confirmation it was successfully linked but it's not showing on the account.","382997":"Unable to install new update. Keeps on crashing. Can't open the app unless updated. I keep retrying and it always downloads everything but when it's time to install the new updates it crashes. So stupid. And the only thing they keep updating is the look\/interface. I still have money on it so I'll try updating again and see if it works. If not, this 1 star stays. Dumb people updating interface instead of functionality, security and stability of the app.","383005":"2022 Works fine for me. Although I like the old interface better. It was nicer to the eyes and I was used to the inbox button being at the top right. And I prefer the icons smaller like the ones before. Anyway, I hope we can get to choose themes next time (not that we need it, just kinda saying) I'd definitely choose the Blue one (like the previous one before they changed it to the white we have now with the huge icons)","383309":"Works fine for me.

This is the easiest mode of payment i experienced. Not only that, loading ur fone, giving money to another individual if they dont have cash at hand. Its a new window of money flow. Sure this will start a new era of how money circulates that is easy as 123.","383782":"Too many updates. Not ideal for old phone with 16gb internal memory since u can't install app on sd card. Time will come u can't use this app anymore cuz of too many useless updates they're putting in.","384886":"I always try to log in my account because I accidentally uninstalled it. But It keeps saying \"Something went wrong please submit a ticket.\" I have tried so many times and HAVE submitted a ticket but it just doesn't work. If this is a bug or some error, please fix it.","385126":"There's no signal in my area. Now how am I going to access this app? I was planning to link it on my Google Authenticator but then the annoying 2 step verification decided to show up.","385780":"Too many updates I can't use it mediately outside when there are updates to download. As of 8\/25\/22, I can't buy load. I tried many times but always stuck on cashier blank white screen.","385872":"I am really frustrated because of the verification process, especially when it comes to scanning my ID. I already tried to verify my account so many times, but it always end up \"unclear photo\". I can't even proceed to the next process, there's one time that I reached the process until the end but it says that they can't recognize my ID. I even send tickets soooo may times but what the hell!! It always end up the same, again and again!! Pakiayos nyo naman to gcash.","386787":"The verification process is so frustrating! Like I've been trying multiple times to get verified but always fails because of the system can't clearly read my ID. It becomes blur 'cause it immediately captures the ID without waiting for seconds for it to be readable","387264":"Been experiencing problem in the verification process for valid ID's.

You're always focusng on some things not in those parts","388444":"Updating my review from 1 -> 5 star.

Hoping for some new fun features to be added soon <3 easy to use secure and quick transactions.","388882":"It's been seamless and convenient.","389317":"Updating at a crucial time is so hassle.. Let us use the app unupdated for a while then update it after a first warning..","391069":"It's a lot better now. Good job. Transfer fees to banks could be lower.","391773":"Horrible. First, the initial customer service rep didn't understand that I was trying to report numbers that are trying to spoof the app. Instead, they reset my password. When I tried to enter the new password, it wouldn't let me. Also, during the time that I was trying to reset the MPIN, I was sent different codes 7x and I only pressed once. Then they asked me to create a ticket and I don't know when an agent would reply back! Horrible!","392834":"9\/2\/2022: Why change the confirmation from text message to app inbox??? It's not convenient at all!! Receiving confirmation in text message is more convenient and less hassle!!! 9\/8\/2022 Why hide some letters in repient's 1st name when sending money???\ud83e\udd14How could we know if we're sending the money to the right person? It's more hassle on our part because now we need to double or triple check the recipient's number to ensure we send it the right recipient!!!\ud83d\ude21","393911":"Why disabling to view the name of the person who you will send money to? There is less visibility to check if the info is correct by removing the name. Bring it back, this makes transactions less secure.","394259":"Too many updates. With high storage needed. Very inconvenient due to updates and storage issues","394552":"Not recommended. Gets worse with every update.","395290":"Everytime I tried to scan the back of my valid id, it goes blurred on purpose and I always encountered failure in verifying my account.

But when I was about to delete my account, the help center always spam error that something is wrong in the transaction. I attempted so many times but still they neglect my access.

At least move the pop up after a transaction.","398482":"I rate it 3 stars since the verification for my email account doesn't seem to be working.

Im so disappointed with the app right now.","405425":"The app is convenient to use. I have an issue on the verification processes, as well as, the (nonstop) version updates. I suggest to provide options for the users to stay on one version of the app. Not everyone would like to go under the tedious updates, whilst having to use WiFi\/data for it.","405704":"Having problems with the new update, can't enter gcash as it keeps saying \"you are using emulator\" even though I am not. I lost my sim card so I can't uninstall and re install the app that easily, I also couldn't log in on another device because I wouldn't be able to receive a code. received a large sum of money there, very frustrating.","406101":"The most recent update destroys this useful app. The app icon just suddenly disappears. But when you check on the Play Store it says it is installed but when you try to open it, it says the app is not installed. Tried troubleshooting it, uninstall\/reinstall it still disappears on it's own. Please fix it. I hate to let you go GCash if this is not fixed then you leave me with no other choice. There is no level of confidence in cashing in\/transferring funds to your app if this persist.","406332":"I tried to get fully verified using my national ID but for some reason, the system always says 'perfect' then afterwards it says it wasn't clear enough or it was too blurry. I tried over and over again, Gcash even deleted my last account with money in it and I created another one, but still doesn't work. I tried to uninstall and re-install the app but it still doesn't work. I hope this get fixed soon, I don't know if they really accept national IDs or not, felt like they just put it there.","406615":"There's a persistent issue when updating the app. The icons tends to \"disappear\" from the home page or app list on your phone despite being present in the app list on the Google Playstore. You havw to uninstall it and install it again for it to show up on your home screen. Otherwise, one the most convenient cash apps.","407039":"App crashed and can't be used anymore. Tried to uninstall it so I can install it again thinking that would fix the issue. But it won't uninstall anymore saying my app is locked, but it's not even in my locked app folder anymore. When I try to search for it on my installed apps it does even appear anymore. But on the app store it just keeps saying \"uninstalling\" and it's been days already.","407063":"I always install and uninstall the app just for me to see the app itself from my phone. I don't know why this is happening. But I hope this will be fixed, because it's really inconvenient and annoying whenever I need the app. It's honestly fast to transfer money to a one place to another, send load and such. But I do hope this can be fixed, please. I'm looking forward to have this bug fixed as soon as possible.","407409":"very bad implementation of wanting to be verified. Doesn't behave properly, tried to took a photo, couldn't because it couldn't scan. Took a photo of myself, get all blurred for no reason. Server becomes busy for no reason. there must be a second feature of sorts. like upload photos manually. than relying on misbehaving scanners and feature. wasting alot of time, as if they don't want you to be verified. \ud83d\udc4e","407908":"Great and very flexible app for payments. My only problem is that the system makes it hard to get verified, especially in this update. Everytime I capture a clear copy of my ID, the feedback will always be 'blur', 'try again later'. I reallt want to be verified so that I can use the app to its full potential.","407972":"October 29 22 It's been a while since I had this review yes it was true but as other big companies out there \"Nobody's perfect\" as long as they're able to fix every issue. Now, I would like to leave a very good recommendation for this app and a big hand to it's developer, the people who are behind this. It's much more convenient, Safer faster \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc4fMORE POWER and SUCCESS! KEEP IT UP!","408332":"I do not recommend this app. I did not receive the money that transferred into my account. It will receive the money from other bank then it will not transfer to the recipient. When you call their customer service they will tell you to wait for 72hrs. This is horrible. They allso do not give updates on the ticket that has been submitted. Useless app. Do not download this app!","408746":"There are lots of issues with the app as it is currently. Biggest one I've encountered and noticed to be a common issue is the complicated verification process. My first attempt to verify my account was rejected and it took forever to be granted the chance to re-do the verification process. Another, I don't know whether this varies from user to user but there are times when the app is inaccessible when using data. I highly recommend that the developers make the app acessible offline.","409244":"Having problems with verifying for almost 2 or 3 months already, I've already sent an email twice to customer service regarding the issue, the response is always the same. Stuck at ID taking, it says blurry (using National ID). Whenever it goes thru, after getting a text message, it says error (couldn't verify photo or declined) so I'll have to re-verify.","409465":"This app is quite useful but since last week I've encountered problems on buying load to Smart and TNT. I've bought a load thrice and all transactions was succesful but my customers haven't received the said load. My e-loading business can't afford to have a few losses even if it's just a few sum of money. Hope GCash Tech can fix this issue bcoz it will greatly affect their service as one of the country's leading mobile e-wallet.","409519":"It has this perfect timing of having a system issue whenever you need it the most, it's frustrating to use, and even if you use it always, some features are still not available mainly because you're not using the app that much. You don't even notify us prior to your scheduled system updates or if you're goin to put the app under maintenance.","409925":"There's a problem with the ID verification, After the verification process, I received a text message that i have to re-take the ID scanning because it says that my ID was a photocopy and not the original one. It's a waste of time to redo all the process and just receive a message to redo it again. Hope it can be fixed ASAP.","411678":"You keep on upgrading but the features are still the same, and it keeps on going back to the previous features. I dont know what the upgrade is for. It just eating up storage.","412585":"Very disappointed with your service. I was asking assistant to verify my account a month ago but until now there is no progress with my ticket submitted.No reply, no response, no assistant.Why there is still help and support in the app if you cant manage well this feature.So disappointing! My words are not enough to show my disappointment with your help and support service.","412932":"Recently, there's a problem about receiving epins through sms, It's been a week and it hasn't been resolved. I wish they can fix this issue. (Update) The problem with their epin transaction is the worst, you have to wait for hours before you can get the code or worse, a day. They still haven't fixed it yet, to anyone who's planning to top-up their game credits with this app, I advise not to try or you'll end up frustrated as I am.","413092":"Fix your verification process. I always get stucked in scanning the back of my ID (National ID). It keeps on saying the photo is blur when it is clear. Make your verification process simple and easy just like the maya app where the users are allowed to take a photo of their IDs instead of using the automatic scanner that doesn't work properly. Thank you.","413569":"I'm no expert when it comes to this but atlest let me point one common problem. A. Everytime you need it the most. It needs to be updated. 1.To avoid complain perhaps send some advisory since you have user's contact number. 2. Updating the app everytime is hustle. Can you atlest update the app at once. Instead of doing it from time to time, do it once every 3 months. Anyway there is no visible change every update. The app is good and i liked it. I hope it will improve more. Thanks","414022":"I'll give it 2 stars because there is a problem on scanning of the national ID. Either it is too fast or not recognizing it, although i have well lit room, prompting unclear\/blurred photo resulting to too many attempts and cannot proceed to the next step. Please fix this like putting a countdown on the back portion of the scanning so that we can take the image more carefully.","414193":"Always so many updates. Can't even use it during emergency times. Why can't we just stay at an old version and just update later?? It's so inconvenient when you need it the most and it'a not working.","414356":"It's good and convient until it crashes or certain features are not working as it used to. Customer service and support is bad. I don't know if it's the recent updates, but Gloan is not working at all, an error prompt keeps on popping up. When I tried to contact support, I can't submit a ticket because of the error in the help center. Tried to reach out to any customer service and there's almost no way to reach out or complain outside of the app. I have so much to say. GCash do better.","414656":"Dear to the app developer. Can you please stop updating the app?? This app alone taking a huge storage in the device. Why do you keep doing it? As if it improves, but honestly its not. The unnecessary ads just keeps taking the space of an option. For example, the load option. Kindly listen to your users request. This app isn't user friendly anymore. That's all.","415541":"Gcash could be an amazing app if they can only provide better customer service. Response time is so long, and if you actually get a response, big chance it's an automated one. I can't remember a time where getting help or answer from them is smooth. It's always a frustrating experience, one that is so exhausting, you'd rather use other banking apps with actual human customer service,not an AI that can't even answer simple inquiry.","415590":"GCash is a really competent payment method right now... if it works. It has all the feature I could ever ask for in a payment app but it's unavailable sometimes. I'd rate it higher if it weren't such a bad thing but the times that it failed made me miss sales or I have no small change for the thing I'm buying. If I can't rely on it 100% of the time then it's bad service.","415686":"The new update was not helping to upgrade the app. You can't open your account even you has a internet connection and data.\ud83d\ude25 Also Problem with buying a load, you can sent it twice without noticing.\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25 Please fix the problem.","415777":"GCash is a great app. Unfortunately, I have to rate 2 based on my frustrating experience. I've been using this for 5 years but everytime it asks for an update, I cannot login anymore. A pop-up saying \"there's a problem with your connection\" even if I have enough mobile data irritates me. Up until, I still cannot log into my account. I hope the development team will address this prevalent issue.","416307":"Lousy app!!! My account has been locked due to an update error. Now, I can't get the money I have in there. And the process to restore it makes me look like I'm the one who caused the suspicious activity. Switching to other platforms once I get my money back. Useless customer service too for making too difficult the process to restore the account when my account is fully verified several months ago.","416554":"Review Update: Changing my review. I kinda like it now. It helps a lot. \ud83d\udc49Very Helpful, convenient and accessible. But for some reason, they removed the portion where you see the complete name of money sender and money receiver on the app and text message notif. I'd prefer the first version especially for us in the online business field.","416560":"As much as i want this app as it's very handy and useful, the constant mandatory updates are bugging me, and it consumes phone storage. Moreover, verification of account especially on taking picture of ID is a HUGE ISSUE. No matter how still you are while scanning thru phone and crystal clear is scanned ID, it always fail to recognize it. PLEASE FIX THIS!","416592":"Worst support. Still have an unresolved ticket that is now 34 days old.","416661":"the app is stretching out my patience one minute it loads my account then auto log out then I can no longer log in keeps on saying error 502 and send ticket I've already sent the ticket but no response and it really happened when I badly need to have access to my account?????!!!! kindly fix this ASAP..will update my ratings once fixed and see how long this will be fixed :( I was supposed to update it with good ratings but after few days from fixing the activation now my MPIN suddenly didnt work!","416784":"It was smooth-sailing with this app but time came when GCash seemed to insist that I update the app and I did. Only to find out that it's now difficult to open my account. It really angers me that at my text-message box would always come this prompt: \"NEVER SHARE YOUR OTP OR USE IT IN ANY LINK...etc.\" I always forwarded the OTP and the prompt would always announce that the forwarding was successful. But after that, no more. It would not go to the next phase. So frustrating.","417024":"It's a good app when it works but very unreliable and the updates seem to bug the app more rather than fix it, from my experience. It's a hit or a miss when you want to use or need it the most. \"Something is wrong\" pops up one too many times and Help Center isn't much help really. Please get it together, GCash. We could really use a seamless customer experience from you. Thanks.","417297":"Absolute rubbish. Not only the app, the support as well. Crashes on login more of the times. If somehow can login, crashes on account verification submission. Update: I submitted a ticket. I got a response that they close the ticket. I responded that maybe would be beneficial to fix the problem. I goy a response. They closed my account because of unusual activities. I didn't know that if I try to login it is an unusual activity. Other activities cannot be as I couldn't login. Same","417406":"Can't open the app. I needed to pay my bills but can't open it. Every time I open it, it opens the system page where the only options are force stop or uninstall. Here in the playstore, only the uninstall button is available. What is happening?","418100":"Verification process takes forever. I've been trying to take a photo of my ID but it would either say blurry or nothing happens. I can't even take a proper photo bc it won't allow me to submit a picture from gallery which is much more clearer, but instead the picture that I take on the spot. 113022 Also, it crashed. I can't login bc it'll go straight to settings and it's installed in my phone but the logo doesn't show on phone. It's registered as installed on settings but I can't find it.","418238":"The app's functionality is great as it's user-friendly. The problem that I'm having is the abrupt maintenances. When there is a maintenance, you won't get a notification. It's frustrating especially when you won't be able to withdraw funds during emergencies. Please work on improving your poor customer service.","418304":"It suddenly went missing on the phone (like literally the app icon is nowhere to be found), it still states as installed in the device upon check on app management, yet unable to launch it - needs to be uninstall and reinstall again to work and launch and use. But after usage, it will disappear again.. like what happens to the app? It works well the last time I checked, last week...","418471":"This app is driving me crazy. It is my 4th time successfully updating this app but in the end it fails to work. Also the verification process it sucks. I wish they should use \"upload photo\" instead of automatic scanning cause it's not working. Base on the review Im not the only one experiencing it. I hope they improve their costumer service. This app is working smooth but the time came when some of its transactions failed to function effectively.","419591":"after the update, the icon won't show on the screen, i can't even open it here in google playstore. the only option is to uninstall it and then install again and it opens. but once you close the app the same problem will occur again and you have to uninstall and install again to use the app. so frustrating! please fix this immediately! edit: change to 5* because the problem is already solved. thank you.","420806":"Horrible! I just want to send money in my other contacts but everytime the tutorial pops up! I didn't even authorize any of tutorials in my account. It's always popping up and it so annoys me! Also, the app says that I need to update it even though I am done updating it in a few seconds. Can you just enable the option to turn it on\/off in settings? I don't care if you endorser is pretty or what, it's just the ad\/tutorial irks me so much. It's sk inconvenient!","421291":"There was a prompt to update, and at the back of my mind, i thought i shouldn't because it is bound to have issues, but there wasn't any option to cancel...after updating, voila! The app DID crash! It cannot be opened anymore just when i was about to make a transaction! Seriously??? PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S GOOD, FIX THIS!!!\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c","422592":"The app always crashes! It always disappears (app logo) from my frequently used apps window. Can't find it even if I use the search bar on my fone. I can only see it on the Manage applications settings only to uninstall and reinstall it to make it work again. It's so frustrating. Also, Gforest does not give any energy even if I use it everyday in my store for cash in and cash out services. Fix your app!!! You always have an update but don't resolve any bugs\/problems at all!","422743":"100% negative for me. It's good the first time but later on suddenly gives you an issue and hold your money for no reason and the refund is too long to process, it appears too hard to their part to refund but to easy to hold the money when it's not there money in the first place. Very inconvenience for the customer when you need your money and you can't even use it for they hold it and it is very unreasonable. SO FRUSTRATING!!!!!!","423374":"Everything was great until a prompt to update the app popped up. I did update it but now it's a nightmare. The app is nowhere to be found on my phone (app gallery). I did basic troubleshooting but nothing seem to work but having to uninstall and reinstall the app for it to be visible one time. I can't even properly file a ticket. \ud83d\ude14 12\/02\/2022 After trying to install the newly released version, app is now visible on my app gallery and working properly.","423702":"I've tried being patient with this app but I've been trying to verify my account for almost a year, and all four attempts failed because I can't upload the requirements needed, but the issue is I can't upload it anywhere; it doesn't let me and I've checked everything, and even submitted a ticket but none of their messages helped me even the slightest. So, please fix this app, it's been long overdue.","424099":"Keeps bugging and removing itself from my phone. Sometimes the code doesn't send and I can't pay or sometimes it says there's an error and try again later. Its customer service isn't any better. I was getting verified and it took over a week, they kept asking for stuff that weren't listed in the requirements. My cousin hasn't been verified even after months. I have a ticket since October, it hasn't even been opened yet. Please fix your app as it's one of the most commonly used mode of payment.","424289":"Fix your bugs if this is one of them. The app won't appear in my phone anymore but can be seen in App Management in Settings. The 'OPEN' option both in Play Store and App Info is gone. Also, I put an App Lock in it and trying to uninstall means turning off the App Lock feature but it can't be seen in the App Lock list too. If I can't uninstall it to install it again, there's no way I can access it.","424452":"Gcash keeps disappearing in my phone.","424538":"C'mon Globe I've been using this for long time and everytime you have an update, all we get is a change of icon and app GUI. A GUI that is getting more confusing and harder to use. And instead of all this front-end re-designs, why don't you start fixing bugs for a change. Especially your Pay QR. Everytime I launch it, it just hangs and couldn't connect to the phone camera. For a long time this issue hasn't been fixed and I have a lot of friends with this same issue.","424649":"EDIT: Can't even use the app properly now. After a recent update, the app keeps disappearing after opening it once. Tutorial for the inbox also keeps repeating. This is getting ridiculous. Pretty convenient during this pandemic. The only problem I have with it is how late the transactions get reflected on my history. Sometimes they appear after more or less 48 hours and I think that's too much time, considering how fast they deduct fees for my transactions. Needs more improvement.","425648":"right when I want to load, it won't load. the Inbox tutorial is now so spammy, I can't see my inbox!","425870":"This app is convenient to use if it works out properly. But thing is it crashes down all the time, to the point that i need to uninstall and reinstall it again. Please do your best to fix the glitch on your system. The application keep on disappearing .

But the apps is still installed on you phone when you go to your phone setting.","425969":"Every new Update within BER months last year, and this year, I've experienced the app can't be found on the apps drawer on phone, upon going to Playstore only shows uninstall option, no option to click on open, will have to manually uninstall and reinstall it. After a day or two it gets totally remove again and had to do the same process all over again. It's good if the app works to its full potential.","426259":"GCash this update sucks. Fix your apps! Because since I updated your apps, the apps icon suddenly disappeared even though it was installed. It sucks that I have installed and uninstalled it a few times, please do something about it. Honestly, there's no point in updating if it's just like this. It's ok with Android 11 and below, but with Android 12, the apps suddenly disappear even though they are installed. Please, GCash, fix the bugs in your update and take quick action.","427357":"It delivers the service it provides and I'm using it with no issues, but suddenly, yesterday the app is gone from my app drawer, though I can see it still installed in my settings and also from playstore.

It makes me want to use the app less and less. \ud83d\ude15 hope u guys fix these issues.","430601":"It's the same issue that's been going for weeks now. Some users are experiencing a problem where the app keeps on disappearing but is still installed. If you go to ps, uninstall is the only option. You are just left with the choice to reinstall the app to open it but after that the icon disappears again. It's really embarrassing when this can't be fixed especially since the app is a prime suspect on leaking personal infos on this ongoing scam texts right now","430957":"VERY DISAPPOINTING. It's very difficult to complete the verification process. The app can't scan my ID properly. Most people are having the same problem but the developers are doing nothing about it. Very poor customer service.","431475":"Nothing short of negligent management. Just because it's the most widely adopted payment standard in the country outside of cash and credit, doesn't mean it's good at all. The app's laggy, logging in is a pain and fails at least once 100% of the time, crashes more often than I can count, and has cluttered design in general, clearly highlighting the features that make them most profit. Stick to cash or credit instead if you can at all help it.","431544":"Update review: this app is crazy. It keeps disappearing on my phone. Making it very useless when you need it.

These incidents will make the app delete itself from your phone, but Google Play and your App Settings will treat it as if its still installed.

If its after a superfluous update like a Holiday theme UI change, its a near guarantee that their services won't work.","432347":"This Christmas season, I had a high number of transactions. Its been so hard since they separated the transaction notifications between phone and via the app inbox. Transaction history is limited and doesn't give all the details. I did my internal accounting and discovered a 13,240 discrepancy and until now for 5 days I can't figure it out.

Maybe stop adding new feature and start fixing the problems, maybe in 2-3 sprints\/iteration you can make it more \"user friendly\".","436216":"I can't verify my account because of bug in your app, it perfectly scanned the front of my national ID but when it comes to back it always display \"perfect\" and \"please take a clear photo\" ( it display 2 prompts) please fix immediately. I surely scanned the ID clearly but It always says it's blurry even it's not.","436317":"I've been using GCash since 2016 when it was still starting to seek for its clients. I was hesistant at first thinking it may not be useful since the offerings that time were 'load only' and 'book movies'. 'Til today, it has offered a lot of financial services which help me ease my daily transactions. 5 stars from me.","436445":"I went to a grocery, then when I was about to pay, then it didn't let me access my account because it needs update, it happened to me twice. I don't understand why need to update too often. It has now became a hassle rather connvenience. 1 star","436711":"The system in this app is very damn bad! In verifying your account, there's always a problem in scanning your ID. Although the ID photo is clear, the outcome is \"unclear photo\" which is very irritating. I tried many times and the outcome is the same. It sucks!","436737":"Good day! Just wanna make a complaint regarding your ID scanner, it takes much too scan it and it needs to be perfectly fitted in the frame even though it's to angle it because it complicates when you positioned the phone towards it. And also after it scanned, the next button is not responding you need to check it asap to see what's the problem 'cause you know the time is gold and we don't just there.","437019":"PLEASE FIX YOUR VERIFICATION PROCESSING, I BEG YOU. I have been trying to verify my account 2 times. First, it said that an error occurred during the process. Second, it said that I was not able to comply with all the requirements that needed resubmission even though I have submitted it to them already. Plus, the verification process is SUPERRRR slow. Even if your agents assist me in clearing out my mistakes in the verification process, it would still just say that my account cant be verified.","437198":"The app is good but at the same time very annoying like it always need to update like every month. Whenever I need to transact for instance because of an emergency I can't use it, because it needs to be updated. I still keep using it since I have no choice, all of the transaction can be done through online nowadays. Better if you have to improve the system!! Like if there's an emergency you can still used it and update it later on!! Just a friendly suggestion!!","437829":"I don't think it's open and friendly to all network, or is it just my signal. It had been my problem since then. When I wanted to register, it's freakingly annoying because it keep on telling me that I need to \"check my Internet connection\". Damn, I can't even access it easily. It makes me frustrated and just give up. The fact that it consumes some of memory space on my phone, it is even harder to get into this app. Why does it keep on asking for an update?","439232":"Wayback before, its to Easy to get fully verified, but now, its so annoying. Even though im holding a clear and valid id. 1. Getting errors, and the worse was getting reach to the limit. But the problem was its the process of taking picture, it's using device flash so get blur, I'm trying to get fully verified but i can't continue the process. 2. When exceeded, you'll get a notification that the code has been send to email. Which take to long to recieved. Already expired. Pls do fix this.","440194":"The app is incredibly unhelpful for account verification. When photographing the front, there are no issues, but whenever photographing the back, there are issues. Even though the photo was taken flawlessly and was considerably better than the front, it still claiming that the picture was unclear.","440217":"it's been a year since gcash unexpectedly removed the gsave feature in my account. I've been sending tickets for months, to fix my verification problem, but sadly they have not yet replied until now, it's frustrating that I can't enjoy this feature. My account is verified, but it always says \"upgrade in progress\" so I'm only limited to 90% of the app.","441130":"Lack of improvement especially in verification process. The scanning of ID are way too stressful. Front scan is working better however when scanning the back part of the ID all it says is that the picture is unclear when on fact it is. After too many attempts it still doesn't work until it reach the limit. May you fix this problem and all other problems so that it would be convenient for everyone. Thank you.","441657":"It took my cash in problem 12 days to fix. Basically, my money was floating in their system for 12 whole days. Luckily it was refunded, but still, their customer service needs a whole lot of improvement. Edit: Now i just hope i could use the app without them requiring me to update. What if it's an emergency and i have limited data?ugh","442730":"There's a problem with verifying the account. It was fine until I finished scanning my face. It directed me to the \"Fill Information\" page but it was blank (there were no fields to be filled). The page couldn't even be reloaded, so I just restarted my device, but nothing happened. My internet works fine and my device wasn't lagging or anything. I couldn't finish verification because of this. Please fix this issue ASAP.","443356":"Common issue is when logging in, the app usually informs the user about a log in error. It's only solved when restarting the app. It's an inconvenience. Then, there is one problem that happens occasionally. It's about using the express send. There are time wherein, the transaction fails and notifies the user to double check the wallet and transaction history. Even though both of them are fine. Not only does it brings nuisance and inconvenience, it also prevents the user from using their money!","444908":"BPI account is linked but I still have to input my account number, no point in linking your account if it's like this. This problem doesn't appear in my other linked accounts though.","445732":"This app is laggier than running Cyberpunk 2077 set to full graphics on a Windows 98 desktop.

I have been a verified user for years. my account was put on hold due to routine verification and it's been a month now, no update yet. I have already submitted the required documents the same day they put my account on hold but no action was taken despite numerous follow ups. I saw horror stories on social media,experiencing the same issue. Hope BSP will do something about this.","446382":"Error upon entering PIN 98% of the time. Need to click \"Try again\" practically every time. \"Processing\" for a couple of days and unable to transact. Then it suddenly becomes OK. Logging in is a hit-or-miss affair. Paypal cash-in and automated transfer for bills are convenient features, but the company is trying to add too many features like GSave, GCredit, GInvest, etc. without fixing some basic features, such as login. (Internet environment: 100Mbit line, no connectivity issues).","446885":"Your verification process really sucks. I waited for days for my account to be fully verified but instead, I received an sms telling me you couldn't verify the id I submitted and I have to submit a clear photo? Really? Your scanner says it's perfect but you're telling me it's not? We couldn't even double check the photo if it's really perfect because it automatically proceeds to the next process. Fix it! I'll change the rating if my account got fully verified.","447009":"I have been using this app for years (even if the fees are quite high, i still find it convenient versus going to payment ctrs for my bills) and took out gloan several times. I just felt bad when they gave me an offer for an increased gloan limit for as long as i settle the remaining 3 installmnts i had on my prior loan but when i did, the offer is suddenly nowhere to be found. I submitted a ticket to inquire but after they asked for a screenshot of the offer i rcvd, no one ever responded back","448128":"System maintenance na naman!","448965":"This app is frustrating! I can no longer log in on my account... and I dont know.. I have already tried and followed the suggested trouble shooting tutorials to solve the issue however it doesnt work.

Sadly, I have been experiencing issues consecutively and it's starting to affect every time I had to use the app. Imagine barely using it for 7 minutes in your entire week, yet still crashes in those 7 minutes.","450291":"EDITED: Another update required! But G! The update requires additional storage equivalent to three apps. For what??? Just a change in appearance??? Frustrating! Can you STOP THAT!!!! Though using gcash makes everything easierand faster, the app's frequent update is quite confusing. It requires bigger space in my phone storage. I wouldn'tbe surprised if one day, the app requires our phone's full internal storage for what? For a minor changes in it's appearance. Quite stressful and irritating!","451123":"I love the app and I use it almost every time I have any transactions especially because of gforest. Problem is, the recent update on its UI\/UX is really bothering me. It's caused the app to slow down and I can't determine if I have gotten energies from my friends. Need you to fix this.","452511":"Please stop with the tutorials. Your app in the past is the best. Maybe once for every new device log in is enough. It is becoming a nuisance and very very time consuming. When you're in a hurry or having trouble with phone or signal, data, etc...this tutorials are making the experience worse.","452950":"troublesome app. I put in my registered phone number. The OTP arrives, gets entered automatically. And that is it. The app stops there and does not go to the next step. Reinstalled. same trouble. Reinstalled a third time. App stops on all three devices before one can even enter the pin code. Have to force stop the app. Try a second time and the app wirks. There seems to be a serious bug in this app and GCash seems to be unwilling to address it. The developers address is invalid.","454700":"Horrible experience. You will have to wait for months for your concern to be facilitated. It reaches to the point that you've forgotten your concern. The customer service are all unresponsive and the \"actions\" taken all circles the same cycle. Which leads to nothing getting done at all. The verification process is also too slow. It takes more than weeks for the account to be verified. I would recommend other payment and savings applications instead. Do not install.","454897":"It would have been a great app with the convenience it provides for cashless and contactless transaction. Cash-in facility is always offline (touchpay & OTCs) especially during paydays. Very inconvenient and inefficient. Hoping this would be improved and developed.","455927":"Poor customer service. The help desk didn't help at all. App is frozen on waiting for the results of verification, while in the back end, there's nothing to verify because my documents submission had an error. Customer Service keeps telling me to submit my docs when I keep telling them that I can't because it's frozen. It's still waiting for the results of the initial verification that had an error","456530":"First off, the loading screen is so slow. It's very inconvenient, especially when the situation is urgent. I have to turn the WIFI off and then turn it back on for the app to finally load. Second, it's almost been a month in my verification application, I've been waiting for over 7 days for the SMS about my application. The agent I've been talking to just keeps repeating the response even though it's a different question. I am very annoyed about how they handle my inquiry. Very bad experience.","456851":"Typical globe service. Hopeless. Tried to complete verification process to make it useful (transaction limits way to low otherwise). Received a message saying verification process will take at least 24 hours. 1 week later I received a message saying they had started verification process and it will be complete within 2 weeks.....based on Globe standard performance it may never happen.","456896":"Poor customer service. Process in verifying the account takes forever. It's been a month and my account is still in the process. They said they gonna send message within a day. When you logged in, they said 1 week, but it's over a month now and still not verified. Provided all the documents needed. I will not recommend using this app. Terrible service.","457099":"Horrible experience. Such a poor customer service, your complain would take months and their response to you keeps on repeating but at the end, they wouldn't be able to resolved it. And now, I can't even log in my account because of the error that keeps popping up.","457238":"It's been a month I believe since I tried to verify my account but it's always on error afterwards. I've tried and look for what's wrong but there is not. I tried again this time of the month to verify, the problem now is on the image when capturing. It always blurs even my camera is fine. The front id captures fine but when capturing the back of the id, it always like that, the blurring stuff. I'm sorry but I'm so frustrated about this! Please fix it, thank you!","457257":"Too good to be true But thank god u guys created this to people that can't save up money","457265":"When you open the app, it will take 3-6mins of loading before it proceed to the log in screen. If I want to open it fast, I had to turn my wi-fi off then turn back on or use mobile data. It's very incovenient. It was not like this last year. I've cleared app cache, reinstalled app, and update but still the same.","458718":"It is slow as heck, most of the time it buffers even if I have a good wifi or data connection. It has good features but you can't even access it since it has such a long loading process just to get to your account. Not to mention it forces me to update even if I just updated it recently. So I have to do a double download and have double the storage cost for just one update. Pls fix these issues and I will be a happy costumer.","460671":"This app has become very intrusive. Accessing camera for selfie when you open the app. What if you accessing it in you room, and somebody in the background is naked or not properly dressed, How can we be so sure that privacy is not violated. I think it has become inconvenience. There should be an option to turn it off, account holder should be given an option and education of security level they prefer in relation to convience and privacy they can comprise.","461087":"Loading screen keep saying to try again. I need to restart the app before using it. A tiny inconveniece but a big thing when you are using it for quick transactions (e.g. paying via QR, buying load, etc.) As usual, the app is very helpful for digital payments\/transactions. QR function is very easy to use. Hoping for more improvements.","463377":"i am extremely satisfied with the GCash app. Its user-friendly interface and diverse features make managing my finances a breeze. From quick money transfers to paying bills and even online shopping, GCash has got it all covered. The security measures in place give me peace of mind, and the customer support is always responsive and helpful. I highly recommend GCash to anyone looking for a seamless and secure digital wallet experience.","464181":"All these years later, it's STILL buggy as hell. Some features worked fine, then after an \"update\" suddenly don't work anymore. Like the biometrics login. The reason I used to have this one is because I obviously don't want to keep typing in my code when I access the app and it was just fine until the update. Wow. Why even have it a \"feature\" when you decide to break it with an update? Great job (sarcasm)","464550":"Using gcash is a total waste of time. I loaded my number. The load was not received, but it was deducted to my account. I sent plenty of tickets to appeal for a refund, but the customer service ignored my messages. No refund was given. If you value your hard earned money, never ever try to use gcash. Paymaya may be better. I was frustrated and disappointed with the service.","464792":"Lagi nlng nag-uupdate. Is it really necessary to do that lagi?","464822":"I am very satisfied on this app but due to the unsolved problem. I want to give it 1 star. The tickets for your complaints will not be able to solved and they will only give you another email. Then after you comply. \"Solved\" was on the ticket. Which is unsolved. I cannot verify my id.

Also, it always ask to be updated and it happens when we have to use it urgently. After how many updates, you still haven't fixed the bugs.","467911":"I don't remember having face recognition activated. What the hell. Remove that option. It's a hassle to have face recognition everytime I open my app. Since when did this started? You don't even have any notification that it will be added to the feature. Its better to use a different App then GCash","468508":"Abrupt maintenance on a regular basis without prior announcement makes it unreliable for a financial app. You shouldn't fully rely on this app for you financial needs. Imagine having an emergency and you need funds but can't access your account due to maintenance without prior advisory. And it's getting buggier and slower each update when they add new things nobody really needs.","471083":"Too many glitches","471497":"The verification process is so frustratingly slow. I've continuously spammed their support through the ticket but they just keep on ignoring me. I have never seen such unprofessional, incompetent, and poorly trained support all my life. To all of you guys who are planning to install and use this app for your online payment or other use, I highly recommend not to install this app. And also funds here are not secured as well, sometimes it gets transfered to another accnt w\/o your authorization.","471571":"Too many updates... Almost every 3-4 weeks u can't open unless u update which is very irrelevant. >>>>New look of greenery is nice but app becomes too slow... Or always closing.... Irritating sunce u always need to log in for security purposes which is fine..but if its closing in the middle of transaction is not efficient.","471943":"It was good but when it comes to customer service, they are quite slow and would take DAYS to even handle you, even the replies would be slow and nonconsistent. Edit: And now it doesn't work. Great! Just great!","472097":"It's a multipurpose app and I like it. However, it conducts too much maintenance activities where you can't access funds when needed. The app becomes less reliable because of it. Also, please remove the *** in the name of sender\/receiver, its confusing.","472683":"Always on maintenance! So disapppointing when you need to access your funds and then boom maintenance everyday!","473192":"Won't allow me to next step on verifying my account. Very frustrating as I keep un installing the app and try again but it didn't work. the system kept sending me the same verification code without any success. This made the verification process frustrating and unproductive.","473370":"This was an excellent application, problem is their verification. When you decided to choose \"do it later\" buttom to submit the necessary documents, you won't be able to submit it later on. Do your job well!

It happened a lot of times, give me my money back!!!! YOU NEVER DID RESOLVED MY PROBLEM! SCAM!","473572":"No protection to users. The team will not help you if you send money incorrectly even though they know the person you accidentally sent it to. I've been using this app for a while and they never help me.

Except if it comes from my gallery. Pls fix this problem.","474565":"App did always say something went wrong, sending OTP takes too much time before receiving. PAKIAYOS GCASH !!!! Too many updates that causes so much inconvenience when you need to use the app. And no advisory or head's up that the app will go under maintenance!","475060":"The app is not stable, you'll have to think twice since the app is useable now then later it gives you multiple errors in the middle of a transaction, please optimise the app and make it secure.","476220":"Very slow. I have been waiting for so long for the transactions to proceed, i thought there is a problem with my internet connection but it turns out, it's all this app. Also, a lot of transactions failed even when there is no maintenance going on.

Took my money lightning fast but can't return it the same way!","476951":"app is always down, shows error codes and is becoming inconvenient to use. To get rid of the bugs you need to uninstall the app and install again. This happens every time you have a systems maintenance. some merchants and stores overtly discourage customers from using this because most of the time processing is slow.

They also respond real slow!! Unfortunately for me, I still cant access my account as of writing!","477480":"Good app in terms of centralizing product offers but unintuitive when it comes to user concerns. Example is the forced upgrade system. You have no option to do it later. It's annoying when you urgently need to resubscribe to a plan that's about to expire.

In general, I think the devs disregard the importance of beta testing and feedbacks.","477507":"I love this app. Definitely one of my go-to e-wallets. Very convenient and offers a lot of services.

I still have a lot of money there.","484735":"It's not possible to use the app if not updated. Too many updates without advisory. Not handy for urgent matters, I had to wait 5-10 mins for the update before I could use the app.","484993":"It's keeping me at the verification process stage and it's been frustrating me for 3 days. I followed the steps for the selfie scan, well lit room, face in frame, etc. It keeps saying to retry. And in the rare times it processes right, it says error.

Very disappointing","485617":"I deleted cache, then data, then ultimately reinstalled the app just to get it running. Mind you, i just reinstalled it so it's the latest version but it told me that i'm using an outdated version and needed to update. It wouldn't let me in.

You are going to lose users if you keep on making subpar and awful updates.","485829":"If there is a zero review option, I'll give it zero.

It would be significantly more convenient if the app was not constantly giving unwanted update notifications or pop-ups that get in the way when you just want to make a transaction. Verification of PIN can be spotty at times. No way to get rid of unwanted ads. Occassionally logs you out for no discernable reason.","488475":"Overall a great app to have. Almost all bills can be paid online which is very convenient. One problem though, after the most recent update, an error message keep popping up saying 'Something is wrong\" well duh something is really wrong because the error was not addressed properly. Then the app closed and cannot be opened again. Update: Just recently I cannot see my linked accounts anymore. Tried to pay restaurant using Gcash unfortunately I can't cash in with my linked account. I looked stupid.","488914":"Update: Don't log us out! It's so hard to log back in. 'Processing...' seems endless. I think it's inappropriate for Globe to require access to our entire contact list, etc in order to use GCash to send money when it's possible to program it so that you can enter one person's cell phone number or email address. And customer service is virtually nonexistent nowadays. Why do I need to scan my ID when it can be programmed so I can upload it?","488964":"Your verification process needs a lot of improvement, it is very limited and not flexible. I've wasted my time to in accomplishing my National ID only to be not accepted by your lame scanner. Also please stop the pop ups, gosh your app is very laggy!","488997":"Verification process is extremely terrible. Kept submittjng tickets and they will close and resolve it but my account is still stuck in verifying status. More than a month now and it still in in verifying and wait for 7 days without any changes.. My money is stuck and unable to transfer it because this app sucks. would rather go with paymaya at this point.","490056":"I love how it makes so many financial transactions easy. I just hope that it can be operated offline for example like *143# in case the user runs out of data. You have to always check your account balances to report app errors like double\/unauthorized payments and failed transfers (balance has to load before transferring). Takes up a lot of memory. Gloans can't be transferred so when they debit they don't show in the app history only in requested statements. They also delete complaints history.","490159":"UPDATE 7\/13\/23: Do not update to the latest version, because now it refuses to start if it detects that you have enabled Developer Options in your Android settings. LOL. Why, do your devs think hackers would be lessened if you force that requirement on users? There are perfectly legit reasons to have Developer Options turned on, advanced users need that for performance monitoring & security. You're just adding an additional annoying step just to use your app, & it won't stop dedicated hackers.","490186":"After I installed the latest update, I got an error after logging in: (We have detected an untrusted connection in your device. Please switch your network connection so you can safely open this application. This app will be closed for your protection.) There is nothing wrong with my internet and it\u2019s the same one I\u2019ve been using for years. Please tell me the solution for this problem.","490199":"It's all fine and dandy, pretty decent electric wallet app to be used. Until the latest app update, which is trying to force me to turn off my developer mode settings for it to be accessed. Huh?? How is that a danger? Literally unusable now, not even going to think of using this app despite my recent spike in activity of the app. I had dev mode turned on for more accessibility (monitoring input) and now I can't even do that. 1 star, will not change until the app fixes itself.","490205":"Worthless app. IInstead of improving their security, they just removed developer options from the users' end. I can't also connect after disabling this option saying that I'm connected to an 'untrusted network'. GLOBE don't trust their own mobile data now huh? If there's zero stars here I'd be happy to give it a 0 but 1 is the lowest I can go","490216":"This is the second time that I can't access my account for no reason! Too many updates results in bugs and errors in the app. I have to uninstall and reinstall it again not knowing if it's going to work or not. Fix your app!","490380":"The app only accepts limited ID's, aside from that it keeps on giving an error message during verification process. Hence, even if you have a valid and accpted ID, it's still difficult to verify your account. And an unverified user CAN receive money but cannot do other transactions - your money will be stuck there. Lastly, even email verification has errors too. Plus you won't receive the initial code unless you click on the resend code. But the code you will receive won't work anymore.\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21","490789":"It's aggravating everytime it updates. It is very inconvenient","491493":"On ny 2019 review, I suggested another layer of security verification like an OTP for cashout and cashin features, especially for Unionbank. Thank you becausenwe now have that today! Hurrah! \ud83d\ude0a","492935":"I don't know how they base the gscore, and also their cash back system, I've tried apply for bpi credit card with their terms and conditions I've waited 90 days but their cash back did not credit on my account. Only to find out that they declined my cashback for whatever reason idk. And they want me to be the one to contact their partner merchant. I'm so disappointed.","493230":"Its great. But the email verification process is so bad. Literally takes 10 - 15 minutes for the code to get in. By that time, the app has already automatically logged me out due to inactivity. If you can't verify your email here, why use the app anyways? Do not recommend because of that.","493687":"Useful app for loading and money transfer but everything now has transaction fee including loading your own cellphone number","493853":"Eversince the update, the app is always missing on the home page. Whenever i check the app management settings, it's there. But the app itself is missing from the home page. I couldn't use it anymore. I need to uninstall then install again the app for it to appear. Then after a while it will be missing again. What's happening?","494066":"The interface is getting worse. I used to be able to configure items on the home page, this is no longer possible. There is a favorites menu on the services page but that is one extra step. I used to be able to access my Gcredit directly, now I have to go through one extra step by clicking Borrow. And I could not even put this oft-used feature as one if my favorites. And WHY DO I NEED TO HO THROUGH THE TUTORIAL OF EVERY PAGE EVERYTIME THE APP IS UPDATED!?!","494483":"Helpful in paying bills and sending money. I also like that it has features such as GSave and GInvest. The downside is the slow loading, and I frequently encounter error when logging in (Something went wrong). When there's a GCash software update, I wish users can still use the app without updating first. Sometimes I need to quickly pay for a transaction, but I can't use the app and have to wait for the software update to finish because it is mandatory even if it just minor update.","495219":"The Gcash in *143# is no longer available. It's very convenient to be honest, why did the developer removed it?","495255":"-Too slow -Not really a user friendly, the UI that changes everytime became very hard to use. -Might as well keep it simple and much easier and faster to Load. -Please stop that inconvenient pop up everytime it opens, it's already slow enough.","495397":"Always have errors and I can't buy load when I needed. Update: After years of using this app, with additional features and updates, hoping they will improve and fix the things that needs to be fixed, same problems are still there. Sudden maintainance without warnings to users in any form( text message, in app notification and message etc), \"something went wrong\" errors all the time you are using this app even when I have a strong signal and didn't do anything to cause theses errors.","495442":"it's very annoying especially when you are requesting to verify your email. They'll send a message after 10minutes. And when you're going to input it, it says that the code has expired.. doing this for almost three days cause I wanna access the gsave and ginvest but my email hasn't verified yet. My internet is very stable yet they can't send an OTP right away.","495953":"The app has very disappointing first impressions when you try to sign up and verify an account. 1. The 6-Digits Authentication takes a LONG time until it sends a code (approximately 3 hours.) 2. Trying to scan the ID is miserable to do cause EVEN at the perfect angle, a message will pop-up saying \"ID scan Failed. Unclear.\" 3. I was ready to do the selfie, however when i tried pressing NEXT, it does nothing. I pressed it many many times but nothing works. Can you kindly fix these please GCash?","496149":"I've been using this since the day I verify it and it's so good since every time my family send some money I don't have to go outside my house to get it since they can just send it through gcash...but at first I was so frustrated cause it's hard to verify it and I have to keep verifying that's the only problem I encountered at first but overall it's really good to use this app ... thank you gcash","496452":"After I update it to the latest (since we have yo choice but to update it everytime) It gives an error message that the app stopped working. This is after putting in the PIN. Could you please not force everyone to update it everytime you change the appearance of the app? Not very helpful at all. Its just eating space in the phone. The transactions were good. It's the logging in thats not easy most of the time.","497363":"Too many updates! Too much inconvenience, I can't count how many times I updated this app in a year maybe it's time to switch on other apps.","497733":"This app is very useful actually. The only problem i encounter is, the icon keeps on disappearing all the time. So tired of uninstalling and installing again, face verification and so on. Tried to bring back the icon without uninstalling but didn't work. I dont know if my phone has the problem or the app...","499303":"The app itself is glitchy, there are times where the app icon goes missing in my menu and it sometimes wont start no matter how many times I click it. I'm forced to reinstall the app but can't use it when I'm away from home cause it needs my mother's face verification. There are also times when I can't log-in and it says error and try again.","500331":"Welcome to distopia! Where you belong to them! Leave your privacy and human rights at the door. Uninstalled. Never fully verified and now have no Sim since the government insist on using them for surveillance.","500339":"Since the last update, I've had to reinstall the app twice because it keeps disappearing from my list of apps! What's happening?! Am I an isolated case or are there others experiencing the same? Please fix the issue asap as it can easily become an annoyance if it continues to happen.","500665":"too many updates, they will force you to update this app in order to use it.","501229":"Verification process takes time. My first attempt in verfying failed because the photo was \"blurry\"\/ \"too dark\" but the thing is, its clear and readable. After sending them 2 times, they did not accept my verification. So i tried again. It says I will be sent a SMS within 7 days but it's already more than 7 days.","501294":"At first, I find it very useful especially when I do most of the times the transaction online. But this past few days. It seems like I am quite having a hard time logging in. It was stating some connection error. But our internet is working fine and the it suggests troubleshoot. Now, I do troubleshoot but still the same. Please fix this kind of issue. Been having a hard time now.","501970":"I'm having an issue getting my account verified. Scanning my face was such a struggle. Though my face was clearly fitted on the frame and is well-litted but it always says error and it's really frustrating cause you got to start up from the beginning when verification process reached its limit. I didn't also like the recent update since I've been experiencing some few issues using it. I'll give it 1 star for now, I hope you fix this problem.","502026":"This apps is useful but everytime it updates it stucks. I have to uninstsll and reinstall which takes time to do it. Lately there were so many updates and and its so annoying that you have to spend time for it especially that your busy at work and you need it asap and when you open it it says you have to update. Also most of the time if when almost 15th or end of the month the apps really get worst. Hoping that this problem will resolve soonest possibe","502246":"Verification process is frustrating. I keel using my ephilid and yet, scanner does not work despite having a well lit environment and the capture was clear. I am disappointed with this incident and I wish this could be addressed","502473":"Every new update is bad. What previously works suddenly doesn't. And updating is so frequent. Updates are fine if they improve the experience and security. But no! Critical functions suddenly doesnt work. I'm very close to ditching this app and service. I can't trust my money with Globe.","502477":"The app is very beneficial because it contains all the transactions I need. The bad side is that the app is very slow and is always lagging and it requires people to update every single time yet nothing has changed. Please fix the bug and slowness coz after all the updates I expect it to be fast like how we use facebook or messenger.","502585":"Horrible customer service! I have submitted 3 tickets now and out of 3, 2of them have the status \"closed\" even though nothing has changed for my situation. I have a issue that prevents me from verifying because it states \"We're verifying your account\" even though I have not submitted any application The first ticket acknowledged that I have encountered an error but nothing happend and all of the sudden my ticket was handled than closed and my second ticket was just closed after an auto response.","503675":"Edit: My rating changed, again: 1. purchasing load cannot be processed, 2. Annoying and unnecessary pop-up ads when opening\/accessing after mpin(an option for users to show it or not should be implemented or show the ad in the middle of the U.I. like a small but noticeable banner) 3. App crashes unexpectedly(for multiple times) I can make a list but the limit here is 500. TLDR: This app has improved(in some areas)but needs more major(and some minor) fixes.","503846":"Never ending update that I don't know if it is helpfull or not.","504170":"The app keeps disappearing from the App Drawer. The issue started around October. The app disapeared all of a sudden and when I looked at the Playstore, the only option is to uninstall. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it worked for a couple of days. Until it diaappeared again. I was thinking that it was a problem with my phone, so I had to reset it. Installed the app again with a fresh setup. Worked for a couple of days and its gone again. 08\/02\/2023 Issue happened again today.","504381":"I have been trying to log in for the past few weeks, but the result is always \"Something went wrong.\"I have tried every method available like reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, clearing cache, but it still doesn't work. It can't log in to my accounts on both android and iPhone. Submitting a ticket also doesn't help. This app is so buggy. You might as well use another e-wallet app.","504701":"When you make a new update, please if the account cannot be verified because of lacking of information or mistaken, it shall be re-verify again not waiting us for months or years waiting for the \"wait for 7 days\". it is easy to buy because it is budget friendly yet so hard to buy another sim card because you have to make another account in this app. Or it would be better if there's a continuation for the verification if there IS STILL LACKING of INFORMATION. Thank you!","504712":"It keeps having an error whenever I login. And too hard to log in sometimes. The best feature, which is the SMS update (whenever someone send you money, it will text you) was removed in which I think is unwise to do. Because for convenience, people like me depends on it (like the man i encountered in the market saying it was too hassle for him especially his running a business). I hope you'll bring back that feature. Thanks.","505168":"Every time I open the app, it tells me something's wrong and to to try again later. I restart it, then it works. Almost every time I open the app it asks to update. It won't let me in unless I do. I usually open the app outside where data is limited and slow. So here's a well thought out 1-star. Edit: I opened my app today. Got screwed updating while outside with weak internet. So fracking convenient.","505518":"The app keeps disappearing on my app tabs even though I didn't uninstall it. When I checked the playstore, it states that the app is still installed. I have to go to the trouble to uninstall and install it again just to be able to use it. I hope that the developers can make a solution for this issue.","505666":"This app is convenient to use since everyone have it. But this app is really not helpful just incase you might encounter some problems. Especially with disputes. Their customers service and help center not even the email and Facebook page is not helpful. It's as if you are talking to a robot. I have an open ticket regarding a refund but it's taking weeks before i got an update then when i got it it's just a system generated message it doesn't really help me. So inconvenient and unnecessary.","505780":"Update: Still bugged on the insurance portion of the app. The auto payments to Singlife insurance is not reflected in the transaction history.","506115":"Huge banner ads in the app. That's just disgusting. There are 4 kinds of \"send\", padala, and transfer. Why not put remit, transmit, pay, convey, wire, and dispatch as well? Para mas magulo. Always some useless message when opening, making payments a slower process. Always \"something went wrong\" when opening. Edit 7\/17\/23: \"something went wrong\" every friggin' time I open the app. Now, it just won't open. PH fintech at its finest. Keep this up, and Maya will take over.","506265":"The app keeps disappearing from the App Drawer.

Until it disappeared again. I was thinking that it was a problem with my phone, Installed the app again with a fresh setup. Worked for a couple of days and its gone again.","506851":"First of all, why does your app keeps disappearing on my homescreen? Secondly, your service got slower as the time went by. Third, I've been trying to verify my account for the past months but it doesn't work on me for unknown reason, I already tried a few times. Your app only responds fast whenever I try to pay for something online.","506900":"The app should add more valid ID's on their list to get fully verified. I've been wanting my account to be fully verified for so long but all of my ID is not on the list. You should update your program about that. I'll change my rating when there is already a progress about that.","506965":"BEWARE! High risk and USELESS customer service! I want to recover my MPIN, doing so you will need to undergo selfie verification which do not work. It keeps on failing. I tried to contact customer service and they are the worst. They have no intention of helping you at all. They will just send you instructions which can be found in the help page, then they will close your support ticket without offering any solution. There is a HIGH RISK lossing your funds with this app!","506980":"Very slow and buggy. When scanning QR codes for payment, the camera just freezes then crashes after a short while. I had to restart my phone while taking in the annoyed stares from other customers waiting in line. I constantly keep getting errors when starting the app saying theres something wrong. OTPs takes forever to arrive. An OTP I requested arrived after 2 hours!","507303":"Just day two of using this app and a problem already occurred. I was trying to open the app but I can't. It keep saying about 'troubleshooting' and to open the after one hour but nothing happened. I uninstalled the app but this time I can't log in. Trying to submit a ticket didn't work and it keep loading\/lagging although my signal and storage is perfectly fine.","507516":"the app keeps missing in my app drawer. it won't even appear even if i search for it. i tried opening it through play store but the only thing that's there is the uninstall button. this happened a lot of times already and it has been a frustrating and annoying experience!! i have no choice but to uninstall and install it again in order to access the app.","507609":"The same with the experience from a review I read here. My gcash app also kept disappearing from my library\/app drawer, but on play store the only option was to uninstall it. So I did, and installed it again. It worked for a few days, but it disappeared again. This kept happening, and I don't know what to do anymore. The app has so many bugs and the user experience isn't great at all. Hopefully another more reliable ewallet becomes more mainstream.","507685":"Could you please bring back the availability of gcash on *143#? I am one of those users who still uses it and find it extra helpful during emergencies. Sometimes, I don't have access on the internet or means for a call or text while being outside when I need it. And by using *143#, I can manage to do so. If you can't bring the whole thing back, can you please just make the buy load feature available for us offline? Thanks.","507806":"This app should be rated zero stars \ud83d\ude44. Please fix your app. I need to verify my account but I'm stuck with the scanning of my valid ID. It's very frustrating. Please recalibrate it. I'm tired of setting my Valid ID on its PERFECT place just to make it scanned. Also, please do add retry option to every capture. Lastly, please automatically readjust the camera to make it clear. Very annoying. This app almost made me cry because of frustration. Yes, I'm honest. PLEASE FIX IT!","508084":"Please add a notification alert now that you omitted the sms alert for cash received and moved it to the app's inbox. Furthermore, add a way to delete multiple inbox entries at once. That will be a great help for clearing app's bloated inbox.","508157":"Used to be able receive text updates for express send and transactions. They've removed this feature and forced users to check through the app inbox which takes much more time due to loading time + closing all the pop up they throw at you when you enter the app. Still a reliable app for what they do but huge downgrade for me in them removing the text update.","508820":"Very finicky verification process. Starts with the ID scanner that is very hard to use. Everything's fine after that, but then I got a follow-up on my ticket saying I need to resubmit a photo of my birth certificate because the one I initially sent was blurry. I took another photo and followed the instructions to submit, but I couldn't find any button or function that'll let me upload documents. Please do fix this, your system isn't user-friendly at all.","508923":"Everytime I do a successful transaction in GCash and close it, it will disappear on my app drawer. And when I try to search it, it's still not there. When I tried to go in PlayStore the only option is \"Uninstall\", there's no \"Open\" option. I need to uninstall and install it again, so it will appear again in my app drawer. But after a few transaction with GCash, the problem still persist. I need to uninstall and reinstall it so that it will appear on my device. It's too hassle and inconvenient.","509063":"It's been the 3rd week since I first reviewed here but until now the app is still missing from my app drawer, I've sent a ticket several times but the solution you recommended is just the same, I've tried all the possible helpful solutions but it doesn't really help. It's frustating to have to uninstall and install the app again and again. I hope you can solve the problem with your app.","509374":"The app keeps getting 'lost' in my app drawer. At first, I though I may have accidentally hid it, until it kept happening and it has been the 8th time. Went to app store only to see an \"Uninstall\" option which means it is indeed installed but nowhere to be found. Needed to uninstall and reinstall again just for it to reappear. Too much hassle specifically if you are about to process an immediate transaction and voila, the app cannot be found everywhere.","509915":"The latest version keeps crashing. I am not able to log in to my account since yesterday. I am not receiving the verfication code. he customer service provided the same recommendation to uninstall and reinstall. Nothing works for me. It is so frustrating because they are not able to fix the problem right away","509944":"It's very frustrating and inconvenient app at the same time. Very disappointing. It was not like this before, what happened? You keep on updating the app so it keeps on crashing. When you need the money the most and as soonest as possible, error logging in will occur, really? Can't I use my own money for emergencies?","510151":"The app is good -- but weird as this keeps on disappearing on my phone although it shows on Play Store that it's installed. No option to open the app at all. This has been happening a few times already. Any idea why this keeps on happening to this app alone?

Hope you fix it because it the only inconvenience I can see in your app","513911":"Can't recommend this app. Everytime I make a payment or purchase load or something, it's having a problem. Can't even do a single transaction. That's why I'm afraid to put a bigger amount on this application, who knows that it's secure though when in fact a simple thing is making it difficult to process. It's making me frustrated all the time. I'm not satisfied with it at all, like ever. Considering that I waited a whole month beyond before I get verified. The HECK.","514245":"This app is good but there are times that it is very inconvenient to use just like when you have to update it everytime and you are in a hurry. Also, It's really stressful in verification process because of the ID scanner and face recognition. First, the id took too long to scan and it was blur in my first attempt. Second, they sent a message saying they can't verify my account because of my selfie and ID? I tried so many times but they just sent me the same. I hope this app could do better!","514730":"A good app but i having a problem that I can't fully verify, i provide full info,clear picture but it's still not enough it's frustrating to try and try again. It's truly worse fully verifying can't you just simplify it to become easier and much security. Yeah i disappoint of this fully verifying and I'm still stuck and waiting every 24h to retry again and again. F...","514836":"the inconvenience inside this system is their verification process, the system saud that within 7 days, the user recieve SMS that verifies his\/her account , but it is already beyond 7 days and I can't recieve any of them. I hope fix this as soon as possible to avoid inconveniences for the future users of your application.","515367":"The app still had major issues. It causes lot of inconvenience. You cant use gcash when connected to a wifi. It requires changing to mobile data. So it needs data allocation. You need to pay extra to open it. Sometimes, it takes time to load or have connection issues even you have fast internet. Cannot recommended for emergency situations. Enough for e-money transaction such as bill payment and bank transaction. Still have security issues.","515416":"Edited When I followed the last resort of instruction which is un-install then re install, the more it get messy. It's been 2 months that I can't login because of scan or face recognition. I made a daily follow but the answer is waiting a feed back from technical team. Really? Too much inconvenience and hassle.. INCOMPETENT group","515722":"I don't know why but I can't open the app when I'm on mobile data. It says network connection error even when my mobile data's network strength is good. I have a subscription for an All Data and can browse other apps and websites but this is the only app I can't have access to. It worked last week but now it won't. Pls fix this.","515749":"Pretty good performance. Just lacking a feature I need. Does not allow saving the same Real Estate biller twice for bills payment. If you have 2 or more condo units with same developer, you can only schedule auto payments for one. Need to manually input for the rest which is tedious.","516225":"I've been logged out for no reason and when I tried to log in, no OTP is sent. Until now I'm still waiting for the OTP. Restarted the app, rebooted my device and reinstalled the app but still no result.","516321":"I love the app overall, however, it seems to frequently be out of order. In addition, it needs strong internet connection to work. Paying and transferring money is easy with this tool. The tree planting is also a nice touch. Altogether, it's great, if it weren't for so much of its inconveniences such as maintenance and occasionally voluntary closing. Edit: \"Please re-log in\" - this popped up more than 5 times, Unbearable.","516394":"Very small fonts. The application fonts is very small that it basically hard to read. I don't know if it's a deliberate attempt for users to make mistakes so that you lost your money or whatever.","516506":"Please help me! I tried doing the fully verification process months ago (I believe it was around this June or July) using my ePhil ID since it finally has an option to use the \"ePhil ID\". Then, I just have to wait for the SMS for 7 or 19 days. But, it's been months already. I can't even renew or go again with the verification process because it still says that I have to wait for the SMS when 19 days is already very overdue. So I'm stuck right now, and can't even try again.","516757":"Logging in issues. Used to be a great app. However, latest update made it harder to log in. I don't understand why do i need to force close app, turn on airplane mode then on then switch from wifi to data and back, clear cache, and worst reinstall the app and start over again? It was perfectly fine before the update.","517025":"I think it would be better if you can let us know when you're having maintenance or something through notifying us via sms or via app. We would just be shocked that the app won't open or it would say \"this feature is temporary unavailable\", it's very inconvenient. I hope you consider this. Thank you.","517125":"Unreliable app! Too many issues and bugs and I am always having an issue every time I try to access my account it always says there is a problem or try again later. And there is too much downtime and maintenance and this can be hassle or frustrating when you need to access your cash ASAP. If this app is not popular in the Philippines, I would not use this because this application is giving me stress and frustration! Not convenient to use at all!","517491":"For the most part GCash works although a bit clunky sometimes. However I have set to biometric login and it always fails the first time if I don't put my finger on the reader. Maybe it should ask you to put your finger on the reader before failing a login? Then when it opens it has some ads I never care to see but the only way to get rid of them is to click on \"remind me later\". A better option would be never remind me again!","517823":"Face recognition is not working properly when logging in on a new phone. The ai support doesn't really help. I have bills to pay and I can't access the app on the new phone. What we really need is a real customer support, not some ai who only suggest what to do.","517924":"the verification process is taking so long","518046":"Its really hard to take a selfie scan, I am in a well lit room already and positioned my face within the frame but it always says that the selfie scan failed. I went outside for better lighting, still the selfie scan won't work. And its really annoying that you can only have 3 tries per day. They don't even put other ways or options for you to open your account. This App sucks! MAYA is indeed better. Its always money for Globe not service!","518115":"Using it for any money transfer transactions but recent update shows unable to open app if developers mode is activated. Essential for me to have developers mode open since i have an old phone thats need animation scale turned off!","518233":"Interesting how similar apps such as Venmo, Zelle, CashApp, PayPal, and even Maya don't require me to turn off my developer options yet this app does. Lazy, bandaid solution for \"improving\" your \"security\" if there is any. Also very amusing to see how I can track my card order on Maya but a nationwide used app such as this has yet to implement said function. Ordered a GCash card but moving to Maya because of this.","518253":"This app is not functioning well. I cannot send money to other numbers because it keeps saying that they have not yet verified their accounts, but the fact is that they're already fully verified, and now I uninstalled it and install it again. I've tried to log in but I cannot register because the app cannot recognize my face. What is wrong with this? I hope you can improve your app!","518278":"This app is a ridiculously pile of excrement the moment they require disabling developer options. Monkeys can implement better security without going through such crude and inconvenient method. I need my dev options for changing my animation speed. To the developers: roll back this change and implement smarter security!","518323":"**Pros: Convenient. Only use this for paying. **Cons: 1)Ads AT EVERY LOGIN and payment\/transfer confirmation. 2)Getting sluggish as more and more features gets jammed in the app. 3)Randomly logs me out when there's an update and have to go through tutorial again while in front of a queue at the cashier. 4)Fees to be added soon. 5)Unneccessary developer options blocking feature. Lazy developers being lazy.","518409":"Since i updated this app, the game credits won't load anymore. It keeps having an error. And its been like this for 4 days. I have fast wifi connection. it shouldn't be the problem. i also tried mobile data and still have the same error.","518501":"Unecessary update regarding developer options. Us developer options user have no access to the app andnit is very hassle to turn off it just to open this trashy app. Take into consideration that some of us are using dev options.","518525":"This started out as a good app but became worse with every update. Sending and receiving money is easy. However, everytime I open the app, it loads so long despite a stable connection. If that's not the problem, it's always requiring an update. It has more inconvenience than use. Please fix this. Ty","518632":"My Gcash mastercard keeps getting declined. Used it to pay microsoft gamepass the first month then the next month it won't work. Card is active and I have sufficient funds in my gcash. Amex is also been down for months! Why give the option if it doesn't work? Wow the gall of asking me turn off developer options just to login. Don't hand your security issues to your users it's not my problem!","518697":"The recent update made the app not usable when the developer option is on in your device. I only use it to tweak the animation to .5x as the normal animation is really slow. Fix this","518784":"Verification process alone makes my blood boil. I have started verification TWO YEARS AGO and it hasn't been resolved. Sure, I have the chance to verify again but apparently, the in-app scanner can't tell my face on my national ID. Serviceable (which is the bre minimum) but NEEDS A BUNCH OF IMPROVEMENT.","518912":"The app keeps closing saying that my phone isn't secure. I'm using a Huawei Nova 5T which is a phone you can't even unlock the bootloader or flash any suspicious software. I already disabled the developer options and reinstalled the app but the same issue occurs, I might switch to maya because of this.","518933":"This app sucks after the update. Can't open it anymore if the developer option is on. It crashes all the time.","518935":"Users doesn't need to adjust their settings (enabling\/disabling developer options) just because devs are incapable of keeping their own app secure. I'm moving to Maya","518977":"U shouldn't make it hard for the people to use your app. We use developer options because we want to utilize our phone more and yet we need to close it just to use this app. Disappointing.","519519":"Worse than useless developers. I'm so angry with you! Your recent restrictions like disallowing Dev options are RIDICULOUS!!!! No other Bank or financial Institution does this on Android! Such arrogance! Now I need to revert to an older version to circumvent. Idiots!!!!","519788":"So many annoying bugs and errors. Every update is getting worse. Seriously dev? Could you please fix it.","520123":"As of today, i cant login my account on every android phone available in the house.. i tried updating the app and i even try reinstalling the app then change my connection from wifi to data. It always says \" internal server error\".. please fix.. thank u","520175":"The updates were unnecessary and most of the time, the app suddenly disappears from my app drawer as if it was uninstalled. Instead of updating designs, why don't you guys focus on the bugs. Edit: From 2 stars to 1. The update made my account unable to use. I can't log in my account and it kept on telling me to troubleshoot. Tried reaching the service center but only bots are available.","520654":"In case of emergency you cannot transfer any money or fund, you also required to update the app even you don't have data. It is pointless like how would you give yourself an internet connection via gcash if you needed to update it first using data. It's really frustrating and sometimes it has a lot of maintenance and something went wrong errors. Please fix this, if I can rate less than 1 star, I would.","520662":"Has a lot of bugs, doesn't always notifies if they will have a maintenance so you might not be able to use the wallet when you need to. Sometimes sending and receiving money doesn't work and it logs you out for some reason after the recent update. After the new updates the app has gotten more unstable and I can't even send money The help and submit a ticket function is useless since it doesn't have an option for my issue and concern and won't let me submit a ticket.","520664":"I can't send money. So I have decided to put it back to GSave. But when I checked, it wasn't there. I lost my money.","520709":"It always prompts that my device is not secure. For how many years... It only prompts now? I don't even know the reason why.","520858":"I'm having trouble logging in as of now, it keeps saying \"internal server error\". Even though I followed all the instructions of troubleshooting, it didn't help a single thing. I can't even send money that is really important right. Kinda pissed of with this issue when I need right now.","521291":"I've been trying to log in but it always says.. \"Something went wrong\" Internal server error Before that i was trying to send money but it does not work.. then i tried cleaning the cache, closing the app and re-log in, reinstalling..but after that i wasnt able to log in again. I thought gcash was very useful and enjoying, but now its a problem.","521755":"Not reliable. App is always under maintenance. You can't do a single transaction during the days you need it the most because of some internal server error. This app is always having issues whenever you do a bank transfer or just a simple express send. It was okay before but today, seems like it is very scary to put money on this app.","522578":"The app keeps disappearing from the App Drawer. The issue started around October. The app disapeared all of a sudden and when I looked at the Playstore, the only option is to uninstall. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it worked for a couple of days. Until it diaappeared again. I was thinking that it was a problem with my phone, so I had to reset it. Installed the app again with a fresh setup. Worked for a couple of days and its gone again. Horrible.","522824":"The app is horrible these days. Too many glitches and downtimes. You'll end up losing customers at this rate. The fingerprint access is also gone too. So much inconvenience.","523981":"App prevents itself from opening after the latest update, when the android developer mode\/options are turned on. A message at boot shows that. This has never been an issue before; I use quite a few options from that menu. Normies.. even showed that I needed to disable the installation of unknown source apps. Ridiculous! Also, these damn per-boot ads and tutorials! I had a line in a grocery held up because a QR code wouldn't scan, but as it turns out I needed to finish the damn tutorial.","524279":"I re-downloaded this app, expecting to be able to verify my account, but it keeps saying \"temporarily unavailable.\" I've been trying for three days now, and it's still not working, along with the tiny text that I can barely click on. And to top it off, this app is constantly lagging.","524806":"Pretty bad experience overall - after each update you have to go through their \"tutorial\". And it refuses to run with developer mode turned on - says \"we detected that your settings are not secure\", lol. One time they had a glitch and returned some money twice - they pretty quickly locked my account for a few days w\/o any explanation or \"sorry, was our fault\". I definitely wouldn't keep any substantial amount of money there. They have a lot of small bugs popping in and out.","525353":"The apps is very excellent, it makes money transaction easy like sending, receiving, transfer money to bank and paying bills. It is not true that apps icon disappear on the drawer for no reason unless the user uninstall the apps. The apps will notify \"UPDATES and MAINTENANCE\" in a period of time to keep you on the go...","525544":"Recent changes suck so much it made me leave my first review on an app. I mean, making us turn off developer options?! Didn't it at least occur to your devs that perhaps there are valid, non-nefarious uses for that (I use it for faster animations, pointer location, and Bluetooth audio codecs)?? Why should the users bear the consequences of your poor security instead of, you know, investing on it on your side (I mean, that's what the fees, ads, and downtimes are for, right??) Incompetent.","526022":"After updating the app, I received more errors in my account. At first, it was an internet error, then I cannot do anything in my account because it automatically closes due to some device security. I turned off the developer options, the unknown installation, and restarted my phone, it was okay, and then it closes again. Tried depositing money thru Gsave. There was an error but the amount was deducted to me without reflecting in my CIMB account. TSssk!","527062":"Based on my observations your app is a bit lacking in many ways. It takes a lot of storage every month, it's always fixing something. I don't know if updating indeed \"fixed\" the problems\u2014 As in \"not-a-thing\" have I noticed that improves. What's the used of updating purpose, anyway? Kindly stop all these updating if your product is not improving in the process. And one more thing, even your response and resolution was so slow. Your VA\/chat bot didn't even address my problem. Disappointing!","527144":"The app is useful when it's working. But there are many things that need optimization in its UI. For example, I have two MERALCO accounts in my name, yet I can only pay one at a time\u2014it perceives my 2nd input as a duplicate of the previous one. I have to wait around an hour or two to make another transaction, and it's inconsistent. Quite annoying. Another one is that the app force-closes when I have developer options and unknown sources enabled, which I use to enhance my phone's functionality.","527470":"It was fine, until it started to ask me to update the app to its latest version. I had no choice but to update it, since it wasn't allowing me to access the app unless I'd do so. Once I was done updating, it started showing some error message saying that it was unsecured; then it crashed and went back to my home screen. Now, every time I go to my gcash app, it only shows that same error message, then it keeps on crashing a few seconds later. Basically, it's not allowing me to do anything.","528146":"For this app are so very useful because the cash in and cash out of money here are so very instant and that's the reason why I give 5 stars although sometimes there's a problem like you can't send a money but that is only okay because after few hours you can send again but still I'm hoping that those problem will be solve so that in times of emergency we can instantly send or cash out our money. Btw thank you for this app.","529382":"I need the dark mode in developer option because I can't see your blinding white app because of my cataract problem. Thankfully there are other wallet app that doesn't mess with my eye sight.","530305":"Unable to use app with Developer Options enabled I have an app that let me block ads, which if I didn't would eat up my mobile data, and another app with scripts entered that helps with Doze being activated sooner in order to help save on battery, letting me use my phone for 2 days on a single full charge Will be keeping my money and doing transactions elsewhere for now while this policy is in place","530380":"Pls remove this update! Your app no longer supports Developer Options turned on which makes my phone now very slow! You're controlling too much on the phone unnecessarily. So many phones are affected by this. I will boycott this app if you don't change this!","530852":"After I updated the app I can't open it again for a reason, it needs to turn off 'developer options' and 'unknown sources' which is doesn't really make sense, in my opinion. Like dawg, what's the connection? These settings are necessary for my device to be always turned on, I wouldn't risk to turn it off for this non sense. This app is getting worse.","531353":"The app keeps disappearing from the App Drawer. The app disapeared all of a sudden and when I looked at the Playstore, the only option is to uninstall. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it worked for a couple of days. Until it diaappeared again. I was thinking that it was a problem with my phone, so had to reset it. Installed the app again with a fresh setup. Worked for a couple of days and its gone again. Horrible. (2)","531648":"App doesn't allow Developer Option. Now the experience on my whole phone have changed to accomodate one application. Poor experience for me. Apps are supposed to adjust for users, but not this one. Some people like myself use dev option to improve the experience on our phones.","532155":"just found the reason why my app doesn't work, after opening the app for few seconds there was a message which will appear and then disappear in an instant it say i have to turn off developers options and unknown source which IS ALWAYS OFF, because of security reasons. and i have to play around by turning both on and off just to let the app know that i turned them off. damn.","532527":"I did nothing, but after the update, and the application is installed long ago, and i didn't encounter this problem before. But now I can't get it open. The trouble of uninstalling and reinstalling is unreasonable; this application is supposed to provide seamless transactions. The problem i encountered: The app is missing on my apps, if i check on my applications, it's installed. But i can't find the \"Open\" and it's not disabled or something, and in playstore only \"Uninstall\" button is there.","532634":"Lot's of bugs and maintenance and the maintenance doesn't even change anything from the app, it's still buggy and laggy as usual, plus the app keeps disappear from my home screen. Another concern was the money inside the app. I get to wait until the maintenance was finished to finally be able to open the app, but the maintenance are very often it's unpredictable to when you may open the app for cash outs. Not very recommended for emergencies.","533029":"I've been using the GCash app for a while now and have generally had a positive experience. However, recently I've been encountering some issues. The app has become unresponsive and I am unable to open it, despite trying various troubleshooting methods such as uninstalling and reinstalling, as well as ensuring my phone's operating system is up to date.","533483":"Updating. The only app that requires me to disable developer options on my phone, so I can use it. Changing to 2 stars from 3, and trying to move to another e-pay service. Very unstable performance. Both Android and iOS apps are unavailable right now at 3.48 pm (Manila) May 13, 2023. Were unable to pay properly, running around for the cash. And this happens 1-2 times per month.","533519":"I found the added security measures to be quite ineffective. It's quite puzzling that they restrict access to users with rooted devices or developer options enabled. To be honest, having a rooted phone doesn't really impact your ability to manage your account or earn money. I used the app with a rooted device before, and it was fine. But after the update, my frustration with the app grew, and I've decided to uninstall it and switch to another app that better suits my needs.","534769":"The app used to be outstanding, but lately it's been driving me crazy. It always indicates that I need to disable my developer options before opening an account. The developer options protect my phone's security and privacy that's why I don't want to turn it off and on all the time just to use the app. The software didn't require this kind of regulation in the past, thus administrators must resolve and fix this.","537055":"I haven't been able to use this app for a few days already. I doesn't matter what I do. I kept on reinstalling the app but it keeps on crashing. I can't even go through the verification process amd selfie because it keeps on crashing. Congratulations.","537445":"The is very difficult when you forgot your pasword. The second authentication won't appear (which is their new face recognition). The option that appear is always to submit a ticket which is hassle. It takes time to resolve and many documents to submit. I always had a hard time resetting the pasword. The immediate solution for us (user of this type of e wallet ) is to create an account with a new number. I suggest to the developer in resetting a pasword there must be an email option to reset.","537595":"The app keeps saying there's an error in my internet connection where in fact, I have a stable internet. I always have a hard time opening the app! It's just so frustrating! Also, the app keeps missing in my app tab. Like, where is it going? I have to keep reinstalling the app, log in again to use it. Such a waste of time doing all those stuffs.","537779":"Why do you need us to turn off developer options? Now, I can only use this on my iPhone. For those who want alternative, you can search Maya or Seabank. Their bank cash in is also free and send to other banks has no additional charge even via Instapay (Seabank). Transitioning now so I can leave Gcash once and for all.","538296":"I had to uninstall and reinstall this app a lot of times this month due to crashes and \"no internet\" issues. I noticed that for every update, the app loses some of its basic features like actually launching the app and the help tab being functional in the login\/mpin. I hope they stabilize the app and fix these crashing issues. Otherwise, people would really move to another more secure mobile wallet. Yikes!","538404":"App keeps on disappearing. Most of the time ,i have hard timing opening the app. It keeps on saying \"Something is wrong,thry again in 1 hour\". I really hope the SMS notification when we receive money comes back. It is more convenient that way,rather than opening the app just to check\/verify. I am now thinking of deleting your app and transfering to another mobile wallet app. So disappointing.","538773":"stopped working on my phone after a supposed \"update\". now all my transactions are halted because of this bad app. also, almost every time when you need to use it the most, the app stops working. stuck on its 'processing' state. another thing, when users are in a rush and need to make transactions quickly, you're bombarded by its in-app advertisements, and it obstructs the usage of the app. over all inconvenient with all of its unnecessary shinanigans.","538827":"As of October 18, 2023, I am encountering an issue regarding Device Security. I am not sure when this started but I was instantly told to turn off Developer options and unknown sources download, which I did turn off after being told by Gcash app itself. Now despite having everything turned off as Gcash needed, it still keeps exiting on it's own and claiming that my device is not secure. I am fairly confident that any software within my phone is not malware or whatsoever and an answer is needed","539312":"Updated it to the latest version and everytime I enable the biometrics as a way to sign in, it disappears on my app list and also the shortcut icon. Now, the fix is you need to uninstall it then install it again to have it on your app list AGAIN. Been doing this for the nth time. I don't know what happened but please fix this. Still running with the same issue 10\/19\/23","539795":"Albert 8\/15\/23 The same with the experience from a review I read here. My gcash app also kept disappearing from my library\/app drawer, but on play store the only option was to uninstall it. So I did, and installed it again.

Hopefully another more reliable ewallet becomes more mainstream. Add Your Photo","539813":"Ughh so many problems with this app! So many problems with my device LIKE JUST LET IT BE. Daming kati-kati. Please let me use it because it wont let me use it because of my device security. I tried everything. Developer option is off and unknown sources. Also my device is not rooted. Please, this is my only device i can use. I tried clearing the data but now my gcash is not opening. What's wrong with your updates?","539818":"I've been using GCash for like every transaction that I have, I even had a debit card for it. Now with the recent update, I can't use it since I have dev options enabled for my phone to have smooth animation. Needless to say it's very irritating. We may have to switch apps because of this inconvience. I know customers are not really that important to you guys, but you have to know that not all customers have a great phone to use that's why we have dev options for the animation to be shortened.","540543":"App always crashing on the latest update (10-21-23). It's just showing black screen then immediately crash. You guys need to implement update rollbacks for users that can't use the latest version of the app. Latest update does not always means the \"best\".","540618":"This app is so trashy. I just updated this app and I regretted it since even though I put the correct MPIN, it keeps saying some error occurred. My internet connection is stable, no issue with that. The fault is on the app itself. And every time I update it, the app icon disappears on my homescreen and it is annoying to put it back again for convenience purposes. This app is the only one that updates few times a month but it keeps getting trashy after every update. Waste of tume and patience.","540685":"I use this app a lot but now it's being lazy and telling me to turn off Developer settings in my phone. Securing your app should not come at the cost of how users use their phones.","540875":"After the last 2 updates, your app always crashes and tells me I don't have a secure device? Even though I have already disabled developer options and my phone is not rooted? Why can't you tell what apps are affecting gcash on our devices. Up until now you still can't fix it and added another obstacle to transfer money while your app crashed midway\ud83d\ude21","540963":"Useless! I cannot use the app.","541990":"PLEASE MAKE UPDATES VOLUNTARY AND NOT MANDATORY WHEN OPENING THE APP. I am down to my last approx. 99.70MB in my data, then I have to reload using GCash, just to make me update 86+MB to update this app, emptying my data and I am unable to reload (need to go outside), hence the inconvenience. I very rarely rate and review apps, but this is just the worst of the worst occurences out there, when the app is for convenience.","542324":"Though I am very thankful for this app because I was able to receive and send money smoothly, I really hate it's too many updates... They are already annoying\ud83d\ude29... I'm on mobile data and it frustrates me everytime that it's asking for updates","542535":"It is infuriating everytime I have to used it, it needs to be updated. It is not just consuming ur time but also your storage. Like as if the updated version is great and is convenient for me, but naaah, looks like the same. You should give your user an option to update it or not, and if we won't, we can still able to use the app. This app is so conveniently inconvenient. Edited to 1 star .. It is still infuriating... Lots of problems encountered in this app everytime I will used it.","543366":"Dear author I am experiencing trouble with my gcash app on both of my two phones. It keeps saying that my device is not secure even though I not doing anything I did not turn on my dev.mode. It closes the app automatically when it pop up..I don't know if I'm just one the who is experiencing it but I hope you will fix this as soon as possible! Thanks","543958":"GCash is a convenient way to send and receive money especially during this pandemic! One problem however, is the frequent updating that is being required that takes too long to accomplish! Moreover, there are a lot of distractions due to ads being posted! These barrage of advertisements are really annoying for us your clients!","544421":"Always receiving an error everytime I log in. Recently, it just disappeared but managing my apps, it shows that it is not uninstalled. To resolve, I tried to uninstall ans reinstall the app. It just became worse as it is giving me internal server error. All the troubleshooting steps available are not helpful. Now, still can't use the app.","544651":"Constant updates that barely do anything and only end up inconveniencing people trying to use it at the worst possible times because we can't use the app when it's not up to date. App always has this strange error when trying to open it up which can be annoying and time consuming. Account verification is a hassle and it seems they cannot recognise official printed e-ID.","544709":"Updates only makes the app worse.","544864":"bad security update, why bother with developer options leave it be! you could just specify like oem unlocked or usb debugging since it's only these features that allows modifications to the device, I badly needed developer options since some settings are necessary to fix issues within the os. Totally uninstalled your app since I'm not gonna bother rebooting my phone all the time just to turn off developer options turning it on again and setting those features on and off just really annoying.","546662":"Your app is very frustrating and stressing me out lately! I've been been with gcash for years but lately I am very disappointed. Whenever I'm doing transactions or paying bills or even updating my personal information, it is not allowing me. It always says that device is not secure and then automatically logged out! I can no longer do transactions. I checked the security in my device, it is secured! Fix this!","547308":"App just keeps on loading forever, cant open it.. they cant even secure customers and detect any scam or fraud transactions. Customer service cant helo either. Main problem right now is that it just keeps on loading, this is ongoing for how many days. Tried everything to fix it bec i thought there's an issue with my phone, turns out its on the app again. Inconvenient and unreliable! \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e","547963":"THE VERIFICATION PROCESS IS TOO STUPID AND TOO MUCH OF A HASSLE. I've been following the instructions but there would only be try agains! and I have tried more than a dozen times! This is too stupid. The camera function of the verification process is stupid too, it's too slow in scanning IDs and finding the perfect angle is so damn hard. Then the face recognition is also stupid, I couldn't count the number of times it made me try again despite the photo being ok and in line with the instructions","548280":"Terrible verification process. I did like 20 attempts already to get my account verified, still didn't get through even thou I have a valid ID. It always sent me text messages that they couldn't verify the photo I submitted and that it should be a clear selfie. Everytime I scan my face for verification, it's blurry. Tried again and again, tried switching phone, still the same. It made me so upset. I tried to get verified in maya app, it only took a minute. What a shame gcash! Trash!","548427":"Pls fix your bugs.. Its always crashing. Device security make this and that how I will fix if keeps on closing the apps. It's annoying really I have business I cannot work properly...i can't even deposit. What device security I registered my gcash acct. Why always ask about device security???","548441":"Absolutely terrible! The new updates somehow deemed my phone as \"device not secure\" when I did nothing to cause such an issue. My device security is up to date and phone maintenance hasn't notified me of any bugs or viruses. So much for seamless transaction.","550411":"I'm a software developer. I need Developer Options always enabled on my phone. THIS IS NOT INSECURE! Because I do not install anything except apps I'm developing. Since update the app is CRASHING on launch, it is due to that option. EDIT: Tried to delete GCash account, but their form is not working due to bug on the website. I've tried to raise a bug ticket there, but the form is not working due to a bug.","550472":"I keep getting errors, claiming that my device is not secure, which causes the app to force close even though my phone is not rooted or jailbroken. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, with the same results. I recently noticed that the app is working a lot slower these days. Really soured my experience on the app and caused a lot of annoyance when making my necessary financial transactions. (2)","551267":"Requires you to update the app","551460":"This app keeps disappearing in my app drawer. I thought something went wrong with my device and tried to reset it, but still can't find the app in my drawer. But when I checked it in playstore it says uninstall and installed only. I had it uninstalled twice this month and linking my device again to the app but an error pops up that I need to submit a ticket for an unknown error.","551536":"Since the last update, gcash app has not been working properly. App is very slow to open. QR scanner camera does not work. Exits on its own. Please fix the app. Please","551953":"The email problem has finally been addressed but now the latest update is the worst so far because the app keeps closing it down","552396":"EDIT: Still disappears, and now throws errors if you don't provide all permissions it \"needs\" even though some are NOT needed for a finance app. Also says device is unsecured even though unrooted. Takes a long time to load, because it needs to load a ton of bloat on startup. Uses Deceptive Patterns such as suddenly showing a whole-page of ad on startup that can cause users to click on ad when in a hurry. Throws in also a freaking tutorial every single time even if you have years using the app.","552492":"The app keeps on closing claiming my device is not secure, I've already tried all means to get it fixed. Enabled downloads from unknown sources and turning off developer options, nothing works. It's very frustrating, this wasn't an issue until the latest updates. I can't even use the app anymore, better to just uninstall it and look for a better app.","552733":"Tried to get verified 2 times. I'm still not even semi-verified after about 2-3 months of waiting. Also, it keeps on giving me a pop-up with the message 'face not detected', when my face is clearly there on the ID. Getting verified is too much of a hassle, too. I'm probably not going to use this app, not when this is so hard to even just get verification from.","552739":"I really like the looks & functions of this app, UI-wise. Unfortunately, the recent update has been the most annoying and painstaking one. Developer options is a crucial feature for most Android users and this app recognizes it as a threat, unless disabled. Hopefully this changes.","553007":"The app closing focrely and says that my device doesn't have any system protection. Also, the verification process. It takes me many times to try again in verifying and it always pop up that my verification couldn't be processed tho I followed all the instruction. lol.","553683":"editing my review from 5 stars to 1 since the new update makes you force stop developers option in order to use the app... also, it feels like instead of fixing the not working features in every updates, they just want to change the theme of the app and not actually do any changes at all but you'll be forced to update the app","553930":"Completely unusable. Would say that device is not secure even though developer options AND install unknown sources are turned off. It was fine an hour before. Aside from that, when I do manage to be able to get in the app, I cannot send money anyway because I do not receive an OTP code for some reason, even though my signal is fine. It's such a shame Maya isn't as widely available, since their system is clearly better. Update: the OTP codes arrived around 10 minutes later, which is not good.","553946":"I've been verifying my account for the fifth time now. The 'We're verifying your account' message disappeared and I haven't received any text or email. Just wow.. UPDATE: After more than 6 months I'm finally verified. I can't even send money because the authentication code take more than 10 minutes to arrive then it's either I'm logged out for afk or the code expired. It's been an hour now and I give up. Service is really bad.","554546":"Trashhhh. Super freaking delay OTP. App keeps on crashing. Auto-uninstall. Like WTH. Please change your team and find the best ones. And now I can't even login after installing again. Keeps on Connection Error every Login and I need to reinstall and still same problem. I can't even reach out to your Messenger. There's a prompt to \"Create a Ticket\", when I click, it's on infinite loading. Your GCash Help Center gosh states \"Coming soon\". What a shame. Please fix it ASAP.","554879":"I recently had a frustrating experience with this app,it mysteriously disappeared from my phone without me uninstalling it. Even worse, when I tried to reinstall it, the app kept crashing repeatedly. This was incredibly frustrating as I relied on it for various transactions. I hope the developers address these issues and provide a more stable user experience in the future.","555999":"so horrible and inefficient for an app that holds something as important as money. the design is very cluttered, app is slow, the app goes down at super inconvenient times, and lately it refuses to open at all, saying my device isn't secure. my phone has no threats, no viruses, this feature onlyy prevents users from accessing their own apps. trash.","556535":"The app is almost always acting up: - It takes too long to log in if it logs in at all. - The QR Scanner is almost always down. Besides these, the app always asks for an OTP even if the biller is already regular. If the OTP takes long to be sent and\/or encoded into the system, the phone is immediately tagged \"unsafe\" which locks me out of the system for at least 24 hours. Overall, the security's system of inquiry is suspect, and the whole system experience rather abysmal.","557013":"It's great, love the addition of the card and other features. It's very helpful and I use it a lot. It does, however, have it's flaws; it's a little slow when loading so it becomes tedious getting to one function to another. Aside from that, another thing I'm disappointed about is the fact I no longer receive a text message when I receive money from someone, I liked that notification function because with or without internet I'd know I received money. So, please return that feature.","557250":"Nice app! Despite of many users, the app is secure and I can always get help anytime anywhere. The only downside is that it is always on maintenance. But all in all, it is a great idea creating this application!","558343":"The app is great because of its convenience. It makes the act of paying for different stuff easier. However, the log-in process has been slower than a lot of banking apps lately (Metrobank is even faster which says a lot). I also found it odd that I couldn't buy load for myself and other people.","558602":"I'm getting frustrated because the app disappearing . It keeps warning me about my device not being secure, even though I don't have any harmful applications and my device is fully protected. It's also suggesting that closing the app is necessary for my protection. I tried restarting my device, hoping it would fix the issue, but it hasn't. I've attempted to log in multiple times, but the same problem keeps occurring. Please, help me resolve this.","559663":"This app sucks, my salary is in there and now I can't get it because of your app that didn't do anything except for dropping my app and it won't click me anything since it will close the app. I tried to do troobleshoot and it doesn't work. I tried to call using 2882 but your robot isn't that good it just tell what ever it want to say and do nothing. This is insane fix this problem right away. I have a lot of experience with you guys and you do nothing but to make it worst.","559707":"The app keeps on crashing. It prompts that it has some device security issues that I have already addressed and fixed, however, it keeps on crashing. Using this app to complete your financial transactions is damn near impossible. If you need an electronic wallet, dont bother downloading this waste of an app. Zero star if possible.","560223":"App keep disappearing. This is so frustrating, like how many times should we uninstall and reinstall the app? I hope you can fix this issue, this is not convenient anymore. 11\/9\/2023 Issue still not fixed. Imagine the inconvenience, when I need to pay and find out the app has disappeared again. And this happens everyday already. This is infuriating, from a money related app at that and it's working this way. Find a way to have this resolved.","560841":"every time it gets an update, the app is getting worse. its lag and full of bugs and errors. If I update it to the latest version, it still says that I'm using the old version. also, it says that the device I'm using is not safe even though I've always used the same device since before. im supposed to use this for my transactions and yet I can't even use it.","560936":"Before: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Convenient and easy to use app. Helpful in my day-to-day living. And it's improvements continues. Almost all food merchants, supermarkets, shops, goceries, and drug stores are its partner. It's like a bank, a credit card and more. Features like GCashInvest and GForest are great too. Now: \u2b50 Laggy, can't log in in times you need to used it.","561179":"Useful for the most part. But recently, my friends and I are having issues with this app. It keeps crashing and saying the app is not secured when I just recently changed into a brand new samsung phone. It's very inconvenient and inaccessible on moments you need it the most.","561675":"I don't know what you guys are up to but your service sucks lately. My app randomly shows \"device not secure\" during a time that I need to transact. I've been retrying to no avail. Even downloaded the app again to fix the problem but it shows the same pop up. I had all my settings checked but it still shows my device is not secure. I needed the money for my daughter's medicine because she was sick but I couldn't get through because of whatever bug that's in your app now!! THANK YOU GCASH!! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24","561735":"Developer options issue was resolved, but now i can't verify my account.","561950":"Oct 11: Nope. I need developer options to make my phone work faster. I don't think I turned on a feature that would breach my phone's security from there. I'll stop patronising gcash until they take this requirement away. My phone, my rule. Nov 12: still have not done anything MYNT? You are the only financial app that does this which is ridiculously irrelevant to security.","562589":"I know I should be grateful for the app because i use it for online transactions but lately, I've been so disappointed with its performance: laggy, updates a lot (but not much improvement), and also crashes a lot. It's frustrating. An app this big or widely used should be smooth and hassle-free.","562815":"Requires you to turn off Developer Options just to use. Which intern suggested this? First I had to deal with Samsung's Knox just so I can use this app, which made it so I can't put anything third-party onto the phone, and now this app won't let me use it without making me turn off my animation speed-up tweaks on Developer Options as well. You want me to change the way I use my phone just for your app, not to mention you don't have a PC app or website that has similar function to your damn app.","562837":"This app and the GCash service is going downhill, as you add useless features and disruptive ads. The main features are all deteriorating, as after years of relatively successful use, I suddenly cannot reliably send money and I cannot pay at most stores. Also I cannot complete re-verification as a fully-verified user which was required for some additional features. The useless customer service recommended re-installing the app, but instead of resolving the issues, I now cannot log in any more.","562879":"the app keeps crashing, saying that my device isn't secure or something. The verification process is also so slow and stupid. there is no option to upload the needed additional documents, instead they'll require you to wait for a week for nothing!!!, and why is the app always in maintenance??","563288":"Very frustrating. I only ever use this app because I don't usually physically get money, so I have to rely on this. Overall, the experience is 60% slow loading (compared to every other app on my phone) and updates that show up at innapropriate times (and takes very long). I heard there are a lot of other issues but since those aren't mine, I'll leave that up to other ratings\/news about this app to tell it for me. It has one use I need it for (payment), it does deliver- but it's still difficult.","564042":"Device security makes me unable to open the app. It becomes a hindrance when paying digital cash especially in public places, most likely when I'm holding up a line (yes, this happened). It has been weeks this device security has been really \"securing\" my money, when the owner himself can't even have access to their own money! The service is very terrible recently, please fix it.","564082":"There are times when the app won't open and just keep on saying \"Something went wrong\" so not all the times we can check out balances so it's best if the SMS notification -when someone sent a money to our account will be back. Let's save our time and effort, shall we, eh?","564103":"What's going on and the app keeps on \"disappearing\" on my phone?? Such a hassle na need mo pang i-reinstall ang app para lang mag-appear at maka login ka, just for the app to disappear again.","564171":"The same issue with other user. App is disappearing after several time using it. I really witness how the app vanished! Please fix, it is very inconvenient to install it everytime I need to use it. Thanks. Been a user for how many years and I am very satisfied. 4 stars for now. Addition: Cannot locate the app, even in playstore no option to OPEN it. Very inconvenient.","564268":"This app is so unreliable. I often have to close and reopen the app to login but now, I can't even login at all. Tried every troubleshooting step. The worst was switching to another mobile number but it won't even send the code and tells me there's network error when I can obviously use wifi. I can't even enter an MPIN anymore because that.","564369":"Gcash is one of my favorite money transfer or banking service (aside from Maya) as it has a debit\/credit system that can be done online for easy access and transaction. The app on itself is very inconvenient as it crashes on the first opening of the app frequently. I've tried clearing cache, reinstalling, check for updates, many times, yet the problem persists. I may recommend optimizing the app for low-end devices.","564534":"Too many updates which makes it more inconvenient at times. Also the app interface itself is slow to respond and many other issues about the app.","564922":"It was great.. so usefull to me for paying my debt, bills and transferring money. But what happened lately is so annoying. I didn't received otp when transferring money, so the transaction always unsuccessful. Sometimes it keeps telling , the device is not secured. Please fix this. Thank you!","565126":"I've been asking an assistance and sent a ticket to address the issue regarding to the verification process and it has been past few weeks, your response said that there was a problem during my application process and so verify my account now, although I cannot access the verification page because the message \"We're still verifying your account\" is blocking it. I've been sending multiple tickets and your response still the same and the message that blocks the verification page is still there.","565329":"Seriously frustrated with the GCash app! No matter what I do \u2013 uninstalling, tweaking settings, resetting data \u2013 it keeps telling me my account isn't secure when I try to log in. And don't even get me started on the recovery attempts \u2013 it just throws a generic \"something went wrong\" error. This is beyond annoying; it's becoming a useless app for me. Fix this mess, please!","565824":"Very slow too many updates..instead of using it the app requires update then I need to wait for an hour coz too slow to update. It always disappear when I was trying to open the app.. what's going on with this GCash.the service is getting worst instead of improving","565835":"My verification process takes forever to be completed It's been a year already since i apply to upgrade my account and my account isn't verified yet!!! The app say's it only takes 7 days The heck I can't even cancel the verification process tsskkk!!","566303":"Verification process has been very irritating, I had to spend 30 minutes just to have it scan my I.D and even after all that, it's been a week and I'm still not verified, I'm not even semi verified and I've been trying for months to get verified since I'll be needing online transactions but I've been waiting for too long just to get verified, this has been a very irritating experience and a waste of time. Just getting verified alone shouldn't have taken up so much time.","566485":"The 5 pesos charge per cash-in makes me transfer to maya and now I am looking other options too from gotyme bank.","566706":"Recently, whenever I use this app it's automatically log out and telling that my phone is \"not secure\". It keeps showing whenever I use the app for transactions. Also, the inbox, there's a time that it didn't show and some of the features didn't work properly. Then the app, always updating and there's no new at all. No new features or whatsoever..","566984":"Before, I find it easy to use and dependable, but lately it is causing a lot of lags and issues like, not safe and almost weekly update which causes to delay services as we need to update before we can use it, though some updates doesn't even provide some noticeable update for the application. Hope you can check it well cause if not, stars rating will surely reduced.","567090":"The app claimed that my device isn't secure and it always took a long time to use the app when i want to purchase a load. I have to close and open the app several times before i could purchase load, and the app needs to be updated every couple of months but the service is getting poor. Updating the app doesn't do anything, it only takes up a lot of spaces in my phones memory.. why does the app needed to be updated almost every 2 weeks?","568808":"I recently had a frustrating experience with this app,it mysteriously disappeared from my phone without me uninstalling it. Even worse, when I tried to reinstall it, the app kept crashing repeatedly. This was incredibly frustrating as I relied on it for various transactions. I hope the developers address these issues and provide a more stable user experience in the future.","569087":"It keeps crashing. The maintenance for yhe system isn't that updated. Sometimes it works but, most of the time this app isn't working because of an unknown error. I think if this thing continue. There's a lot of user's will absolutely lose their trust on this app. You keep on promising your user that you'll fix the system error of the app yet there's nothing had been changed.","569649":"The new update, issue come and go. i already turned off my developer mode and unable any unknown app install. But it still said that my device is not secure. This is so frustrating its been a month till a encountered this again. and yet i dont see any improvement, being a verified user also this is so inconvenient after my card expire, i'll be finding a better app. with a good security that does not require too much from the user.","570023":"TOO MANY UPDATES! IT'S INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING! Same issue over and over again. Still too many updates! Damn, just stabilize your app. I always have to update the app at the most crucial times.","570061":"Sometimes the app keeps on closing while im doing a transaction and it keeps on telling me that the device is not secure. I find it really annoying, specially when I'm transacting a big money. Also, why does the app always needs an update. I feel like I've been updating the app every week or every 2 weeks. It's very inconvenient.","570535":"This app is always frustrating me. It annoys me everytime i open it. it is so slow, always updates, like what the heck i needed to reload or send money immediately it was always, always so slow. Please upgrade this app. a lot of people are using this yet it never even improves eversince i installed this app.","571431":"Been using this for years and I have been verified since day 1. However, I suddenly received a message that I am now unverified, making me unable to access some important features such as but not limited to gcredit, ggives etc. I submitted, multiple times, different valid IDs but nothing happened over the months. It was rather very disappointing.","571729":"Please fix the problem with your app. I can't use it the way I am using it before. There's always a message popping up before i even type my password.

I have to restart my phone in order to go through my transactions and it causes hassle.","574170":"I don't really have a major problem with this app but for awhile now, it keeps on kicking me out of the app due to \"Unsecured connection detected\" Error. I didn't face this error back then so why does this error appears after the last update? At this point, it's not longer an update but more like a downrate.

Also, I HATE HOW YOU CAN'T USE THE APP UNLESS YOU UPDATE IT, AND IT HAS UPDATES ALL THE TIME! WHEN THERE'S NOT EVEN A CHANGE WITH THE MOST COMMON ERRORS\/PROBLEMS. Every time I have to use the app to pay on stores, it says I have to update! It's really frustrating.","575895":"GCash app offers a user-friendly interface with many features, including money transfers, bill payments, and investments. Its seamless integration with merchants and security measures make it a convenient and trustworthy financial tool. It is highly recommended for an improved financial experience.","575916":"It's so annoying that they have NO feedback channel for reporting bugs and requesting improvements and features in the app itself. All their help channels are 100% focused on account problems, with not a single channel to just report general feedback about the app. I want to report that it's very frustrating the saved bank account list is ordered in the original add order, not in a most recently used order with newly added one at the top (not bottom) of the list, or my own choice of sorting.","576548":"So annoying when having bills parment transaction, it deduct the amount from your balance while it does not give any confirmation of payment, always happend and makes me nervous specially when paying meralco bill with huge amount.

But overall, excellent app.","577581":"My only complaint is that it restricts users from enabling developer options to use the app. There might be a way to make transactions secure regardless of the options being enabled\/disabled. I use these options to make sure that the music I play (via Bluetooth) does not have a silence in between each song, w\/c is annoying for me. I have not seen any workaround for this outside of the developer options, I hope this will be reconsidered for those using developer options without bad intentions.","577686":"Can I give this app No star at all?

I did try to apply for the 1st for a limit of P1000, fill out all the forms, submit it, and was advised that I will be informed via email or text message. Never received one on my 1st try. You guys keeps on giving me notifs almost everyday and always try to resubmit the application, but still no approval and notice letter about it, are you guys just tripping or something?","578008":"Hi. This is just some sort of advice if it happens that when you open the app it keeps saying that there's a problem, not secure and then it suddenly disappears. I just recently found out that before you open the gcash app, you have to turn your phone on \"Do not disturb mode\" and ensure that there's no chat heads in your screen. It's what I actually did. So far, I didn't encounter problems like that again. I hope this will help you out too.","578570":"The recent update scans my device as not secure when i try to make a transaction with loading my sim. It also closes the app. Terrible bugs, please fix this. I can't do anything with the app. This app has a lot of potential if only the performance is smooth.","578709":"Update: It's still doing it, no solution to this app's problematic function whatsoever. Every time there's an update available the app itself disappears despite still being in the system itself. If updated, the app is still no longer visible, the only way to have it shown again is have umit uninstalled and installed again, one of the worst apps ever, and it needs to be fixed, if I could leave this at 0 stars I would've done it.","579245":"Recently, whenever I use this app it's automatically log out and telling that my phone is \"not secure\". It keeps showing whenever l use the app for transactions. Also, the inbox, there's a time that it didn't show and some of the features didn't work properly. Then the app, always updating and there's no new at all. No new features or whatsoever..","580030":"Slow and keeps crashing! Updates should make navigation of the application seamless and easier, but what we are currently experiencing is otherwise. Noted that a lot of users have already raised concerns about how the application \"behaves\" at the moment. Your technical team should have sent already a text or email blast about the issue and how can this issue be resolved. Do you, somehow, expect your users to figure out how this is issue can be fixed??? Being pro-active is part of a good service!","580050":"1.OTP delay!!! 2. keep on disappearing on app drawer 3.

TOO MANY UPDATES YET THE ISSUES ARE GETTING WORST!!!!","580066":"This app always let you do an update, you cannot access your account unless you update. And it is all the time. Very inconvenient. When paying bills, it never finishes the transaction, though money is already deducted from account. Also, if you have multiple devices this app is not user friendly. All in all, this app is no good and cumbersome. Dont bother using this app, if you want a straight forward, user friendly, amd secured app.","580201":"My only complaint is that it restricts user from enabling developer options to use the app. There might be a way to make transactions secure regardless of the option being enable\/desabled. I use these options to make sure that the music I play (via Bluetooth) does not have a silence in between each song. w\/c is annoying for me I have not seen any workaround for this outside of the developer options. I have this will be reconsidered for these using developer options without bad intentions.","581063":"This app requires a Smart phone that has a high quality camera. I tried to verify my account many times but the message always says the the photo that I submitted was not clear. My sister has the same problem with her account, maybe you can change the minimum resolution requirements of the users input(photo) so that low level\/entry level smartphones users can fully verified their account.","581862":"kasabwat gcash at globe one app, won't let me register to extend the wifi data hahaha lmao, ayaw magsend ng otp code for almost 1 hrs hanggang nagexpire","582623":"Too many updates lately with no significant improvement in performance. In fact often, it won't work and waste time","582823":"My experience with this app is so irritating. This app keeps on disappearing from my app drawer and whenever I'm logging in it will always say \"something went wrong\". I already checked my internet connection and all that i can do to fix this, but nothing happens. There are also some instances when I sign in it will say \"this feature does not support Android ver4.4 and lower\" even though my phone is in a latest version of Android. What's wrong with this?","583116":"I cant log in to my account for several days now. I submitted so many tickets but there's no resolution at all. Im disappointed because I cant use my money. Too much trouble on your systen and the way you handle your customer's concern is very disappointing.","583632":"A very complicated app, I connot even transfer money on time. Yes! I can do cash in, but whenever I do transferring money it always state ISSUE ISSUE ISSUE even if I tried multiple times, and it also requires an update not just once a month perhaps whenever I updated it I expect I can transact smoothly but just always end up DISSAPOINTED. they should do something or fix this app mostly there's a lot of people using it.","583925":"The app keeps updating even if there is nothing to update, it completely takes over my phone storage and i don't even have enough storage already. The recent face scanning feature is also not working properly, it keeps telling me scanning failed and that i should put my face in frame and in a well lit area, my face IS in the frame and i was already in a VERY well lit area, i even went outside so that its brighter. This just keeps getting worse,now i can't get my allowance that i need for school.","584624":"Becomes more trashy as time goes by. And still timely disappears on my app drawer. So many updates and still trash. And as I was reading recent reviews, there were multiple accounts rated with 5 stars with so little comment. So the app won't fall to 1 star, I see. Lol.","585403":"Experience with this app is absolutely horrible. To login, I have to input my MPIn but then it doesn't recognize my MPIN, then support asks me to reset but only after being sent several delayed OTP messages and only to find that after inputting the correct one that it gives me \"Something is wrong\" message. It is an endless loop of trying to login but I keep getting stonewalled my idiotic contingencies that rely on 1 factor OTP that doesn't even work!","585756":"The new update is not engaging. I've been using gcash for many years and everything is okay until its latest update where you will always encounter the device security issue. The app also always crashes. I hope you can fix this because its really annoying.","586353":"Fix your application. I initially thought that the issue was with my phone but apparently not. I can't use Gcash for ANY transactions because the popup \"your device is not secure..\" is causing it to crash every time. The help link provided does not do anything and it's genuinely frustrating because I use this app for a lot of transactions. The lack of resolution and assistance is disappointing. Do better.","586380":"I am not enjoying whatever update they had. Suddenly, my device isn't secure and keeps on locking my account. Plus they did not close my other account when I requested previously to close it because back then I should only wait for 6 months without balance for it to be deactivated, a year has passed and my other account still exists. :) It's not a good app anymore. Too laggy and crashes instantly - transactions are difficult to complete. I do not recommend it.","586696":"the app and the service are both unreliable. theres always something wrong with this app when you need to use it. my ticket has been open since november but all i get is a templated reply. the hotline is also just an ivr. no one is really answering my concern or contacting me. i had a very humiliating experience paying at a store because the app kept failing even after troubleshooting. so disappointing. a multi-million-peso company who doesnt care about their loyal customers.","587421":"My phone has not been tampered with, it is not in developer mode, nor is it rooted. However, whenever I try logging in GCash by inputting my password, I keep getting an error message stating that my device is not secure and it automatically closes the app. This is very frustrating to me because I cannot complete transactions, especially in areas that do not accept cards. Please fix this. It's been an issue for months.","587422":"It was so much better before. I never ever experienced any problem or app crash before. Now, practically 90% of the time, it crashes. Seriously, I avoid using gcash now if possible. I just keep it on the off chance, but it's longer as reliable as before. The 2 stars are for the rare occasions it does work. This app will suck the life out of you now, ugh","587814":"so many updates almost weekly. it is not friendly user app to everyone it consumes more data to upgrade, it does not improve the quality and even no more discounts of buying loads.","587913":"Always have an update which are very helpful, yes. But, for some it can be a hussle. Especially the people who has to access it anytime, we would have to update first before using (it can be frustrating to update everytime). Although performance is good, its quite slow on processing...which takes up your time.","588152":"I don't know why but your app has become totally unusable for me. Getting a message \"something went wrong. Check your internet connection\" but my connection was fine. Re-installing fixed the issue, but now, the app crashes after saying \"your phone is not secure blah blah...\" when i have never rooted my phone and the developer options are disabled. I have used gcash in this phone for 5 years until this recent update. Please fix this as I can see I'm not the only one getting the same problem.","588207":"I recently had a frustrating experience with this app, it mysteriously disappeared from my phone without me uninstalling it. even worse, when i tred to reinstall it, the app kept crashing repeatedly. this was incredibly frustarting as i relied on it for various transactions. i hope the developers address theses issues and provide a more stable user experience in the future.","589001":"Firstly, when i attempt to update the app, it is missing from my device. Adittionally, upon opening the Play Store, I only see an uninstall button and there is no option to open the app. Furthermore, I am hesitant to delete the app as it may result in the loss of my data and the money in my account. Therefore, I kindly request assistance in resolving this issue.Thank you.:)","589078":"Not user friendly, so many bad experience from this app. It says 'not secure' after installing the update. Followed all troubleshooting steps but still can't access my account. Accessing the triggers negative vibe when u only wanted to pay the bills on time. Every month it ask to update. Too.much memory neede for this app that is always lagging and with issues all the time","589198":"When I attempt to update the app it is missing from my device.

Now it's annoying when you have to update not just once in a month and needed more space so sometimes failed. Updating doesn't make any change, it became slow and sometimes transaction failed. And the gloan i am thankful because of that but now the interest rate is higher than before and the amount i could borrow decreased. It's still useful though for me","589563":"Everytime I open the app and a Messenger head pops up, the app closes and says that my device is not secure. This is really troublesome because I have to repeat transaction that I am about to do. Also, the app is very slow, and sometimes unresponsive. There are times where the app does not load at all. Hoping for these issues to be fixed.","589731":"Suddenly went missing again (this is the 2nd time). Although finding it in the settings to uninstall and reinstall solved the issue, it's such a hassle. What if I were to use It for emergency? I would need to locate it in settings to uninstall and wait for download to reinstall. It often crashes too and has login issues. It it's some other apps, I wouldn't mind that much. But it's a finance app, meaning it's made for convenience and security. And please consider the anxiety it causes.","590747":"not working can't create new account \ud83d\ude21 0\/5 Slow and keeps crashing!

I cannot even finish my transactions and payments to be made. the app crashes endlessly. User experience is awful. I tried all of the solutions\/tutorial found in different sources e.g. YT, reddit, etc but no success. Tried to reinstall the app but the issue still persist. Any updates when it will be fixed?","591358":"Recently, this app is VERY, and I mean VERY, frustrating to use. First was the \"not secure\" notif. that I received every time I open the app. It forcibly closes the app. Now, I think the issue is resolved(?), comes the second issue, the facial recognition. I have scanned my face more than a dozen now and still can't process my face. And when successfully scanned, it says that the procedure has problem and try again later. Because of this, I'm slowly converting to other app if this issue keeps up","592060":"Just 2 days ago after this app have been updated to the newest version, it gives me no 'open' option, but only 'uninstall'. Cannot find it anymore anywhere on my phone. The stress is too much when I needed the money to pay for my purchase but ended up paying in cash. The help center doesn't give us option to chat with a live person to fix the problem. Tightened security is good, but this won't help especially when technical issues are involved. It just leaves no choice but to let stress subside.","592137":"so much updating that needs to be done. i get that you're trying to make it 'creative' in every season. but if we have to update it everytime, just please stick to the original layout, purpose or design, it would be less hassle, even the system stays the same after so much updating. also, stop with the tutorial everytime you open the app, i don't need it when i've used it for the nth time!","593221":"The app keeps on requiring too many updates, almost every week, worst case, every day. It is so inconvenient to users and to the phone storage itself. Edit : TOO MUCH UPDATES!","593575":"Really buggy and crashes a lot. And why are there so many updates? Function over form should be priority. Also, please stop with the tutorial for long-time users. It gets very irritating and frankly, pointless. Don't treat your users as if they're stupid.","593889":"It's good that you can have an e-wallet. However, it is not advisable to use all the time. First, \"update\" is prevalent. You can't proceed to the main features of the app because it keeps telling you to update. Second, you can't use this when you have or the area you're currently at has poor reception. You can't open the app nor do some transaction. You'll get piss because it works slowly. You'll just get embarass to the next person in line. Hope they'll make it convenient for the users soon.","593958":"Pros: all around payments-online transactions, payment of bills, cheaper exchange rate when using card abroad, now readily accessible cash in outlets, cash out thru atm or thru other users by express padala Cons: can't use when app unupdated. So it's a hassle when you need to do transaction when it need an updated under signal\/network constrictions of diff circumstances; difference in layout in updates so you need to navigate again","594050":"Fix this app. It's been very frustrating to use lately. My linked account was disconnected. Can't cash in and send money without constantly getting the error device not secure (Ref 05) 3621:97B8 It will take multiple attempt before getting through. Error still persist. Sadly, ease of usage is no longer available. Keeps forgetting your linked account. Can't send money easily (too much non human error) which you can do in the past. Slowly transitioning to a competitor app to check which is better.","594315":"The app itself is not flexible for someone who has a phone that has LCD burn. It's hard to press buttons, it should be flexible enough that even when you tilt it follows so that you can you press sent buttons, like when you send to gcash to gcash it requires you to click the tiny check button on the corner and you can't press it, it does not tilt. Ask your front end developer to do so, instead of adding new features, focus on the those features that needs improvements. Matsalam!","594494":"This app has a lazy \"security\" requirement that the phone's Developer Options should be disabled. This is not an industry standard. Makes you wonder how secure their app and online services really are. It is also buggy with \"something went wrong\" always popping up. Plus there's an irritating full screen ad EVERY TIME you open the app.","594662":"Constantly updating with barely any improvements and they want consumers to be the ones to make the adjustments for security instead of actually making their app more secure. Good luck getting android users to use your app. Absolutely littered with ads, the UI is slow and sometimes unresponsive, constant pestering with tutorials. Overall just a terrible experience. Don't bother. I used to like this app for the convenience but now that convenience has disappeared.","595514":"very poor system. i used biometrics for easier and quick access, but even the process of verifying my finger print took so much time before it crashed down. it took me several attempts to log in before i was able to use it properly, but there were still times when it would suddenly crashed while i was in the process of sending money to other banks. this got my patience running thin. i swear, it made me want to swing my phone out of frustration. updating the app doesn't help a bit.","595692":"Hate to say. But it is very frustrating to experience the constant app crash, disappearing of the app, not able to access the app for unknown reason and to always install and uninstall for it to work again. For the App design. I'd prefer the simple GCash Logo rather having it to change on every season. That's all I can say. Please fix this issue. This is causing anxiety for both me and other people who's using this app for financial transactions","595884":"It's easy to use and send payment or money. But most of the time it hangs. Especially if your going to delete your inboxes. Also there are times that you cannot open the app even if its updated. Your transaction to send money will be pending because app is not available.its also hard to call customer service if its not globe or tm because charges apply","596453":"Unable to access GCash when dev options is enabled? seriously!? network errors!? bruh! are you dev. doing your work properly do you know what your doing? especially dev options it a built-in function,and very useful in low end phones.just to use the app you need to disable it and enable it again afterwards too much hassle!

Either I'm connected to Wifi or using data this sht still randomly appears! closes the app especially when in a very important transactions!FRUSTRATING AF!","596915":"A Nightmare - I give up. Lost 26K and I can't get it back. My Gcash SIM was deactivated. Tried every recovery option possible. None of them work and half the time the app crashes before I can finish.

Find another option this app is horrible.","597143":"good","597504":"Honestly, everytime I open the app it always pops up that there is no connection, or phone is not secure. Please just tell there is an update or what it meant by \"phone is not secured.\" Because I have double pin so how? On contrary app lags a lot, it is good in a way to save and use for online transactions but I hope the system bugs will get fixed too.","597602":"I can't find the app on my phone. It's just gone even if it's installed so I need to uninstall and install it back just for it to show up. It also crashes much more often now and I can't open it AND it sometimes says there are network issues but I clearly have a stable network\/signal. I give it 2 stars just because it's still quite useful for me but overall, it's already not good. The previous versions were better.","597674":"If I could give half a star or even no stars at all, i would have given it. I have money inside of my account and I can't even access it because guess what? The app doesn't let me. I already turned off my developer options because I figured that that was the problem about how secure my phone was. Still, no response. The farthest I got was scanning my face.

We might as well just switch to Maya already if this keeps happening.","609805":"While using the app, there are instances were it will suddenly close saying the device isn't secure. I've search the net as to the reason and it says to turn off developer mode. I've checked my phone and developer mode isn't turned on to begin with. With the previous instances of fraudulent transactions being connected to inside job and the issue above, GCash should definitely improve their IT Team.","609999":"Though it takes a lot of updating everytime something to improve or update or whatever there is, GCASH is a good application. This is an application that suits in our modern world. It is a tool that let us send and receive money and everything that goes with it including saving! It makes our life easy. And less hassle! Whoever make this app or invented this i can say is thank you!! Just use it as a tool.","610184":"The application has become such a hassle after recent updates, specifically the ones related to security. It is more slow, has continuous issue such as \"Account Secure\" or \"Network connection error\". The steps provided in the GCash support don't even work and I had to rely on the Developer tools\/clear cache option. Called their support number and was redirected to the support center, and when I accessed the GCash homepage it was down.","610391":"Developers, instead of making the app look more pretty, attracting, and such, FOCUS ON THE SYSTEM! There are lots of bugs, errors, and the very long wait due to being so slow that's need more attention to be fixed or adjusted. Developers, you don't need to make this app look beautiful when the job it needs to be done is more important. This app has been recognized to many people, so don't waste the opportunity.","610604":"What the hell is wrong with this app. This used to be functioning properly but a few months ago the app started saying that my device is not secured. Tried everything but nothing seems to work. The most annoying part is that it just pops up randomly and then the transaction you ate trying to do gets delayed for an unknown period of time. Now it just randomly unenrolled my online bank and after repeated attemps to reenroll it, it just says it was successful but once you try the transaction it won","611544":"Fix your Log In Issues, GCash! Processing takes a long time that it leaves you no choice but to force close the app and open it again. Today I encountered another problem where it processes after I input my MPIN but then the processing window goes away and you're left with the Log In page with the MPIN in but NOTHING HAPPENS and you're stuck there. Restarting the app doesn't even help. I have no problems with my internet connection. Posted 7\/21\/2023 Edit: It's 2024 and the issues still persists.","612529":"There's a lot of features in this app but it's really annoying always please check your internet connection even though you have a good signal. Everytime it keeps on processing and loading for a long time even you troubleshoot already. People end up mad when trying to use this app so many bugs and errors. Using another e-wallet applications instead of this. It keeps on updating everytime but services is getting slower. Delayed OTP's and double transactions due to their issues. Inconvenience.","613025":"I wanna say this thing has been helpful especially when it comes for me paying for my online games but I keep on verifying but it won't go tru even I used my student id they say it's ok","613450":"I downloaded this app 2 yrs ago and immediately applied for verification, but until now my account's still not verified. I did contact the support a lot, but to no avail. I'm really hoping this would be noticed so you could fix whatever is wrong with your verification system.","613694":"Struggle much during verification process. You encourage users to verify there accounts but you let the users struggle first in scanning the IDs (even it's soo clear) then reject 100x. You don't even see the hard work of the users to get verified during your difficult verification process then it's easy for you to reject it!!!! Stupid app","615202":"The DoubleSafe security feature of this app has actually made things worse. I don't understand why they can't simply accept the MPIN or code linked to the phone number. The requirement for a Selfie Scan seems unnecessary. Instead of making the app more secure and user-friendly, it runs the risk of locking or banning my account as I repeatedly attempt to access it. I have been unable to log in to my accounts for months now. I've tried everything they suggested, but it has been to no avail.","617045":"Worst app and service I've ever used. It doesn't let me login to my account anymore all because of some security issue that tells me to disable developer options and crashes immediately even if I did. Updating or reinstalling doesn't fix the problem and the devs don't care about it even when I submitted a ticket. Anyone who has experienced the same problem can no longer be able to pay fast and easy anymore. Just find a better app that isn't useless like this.","617090":"Still the occassional \"Unsecured device\" when phone is not rooted and no other unofficual apps. Also \"Network unstable\", even for an 800MBPS Fiber internet at home nor 5G when mobile. Pls. Change your messages and stop blaming our devices\/connection.","617289":"The app WAS good at first. WAS. Now? It's so bad, the tutorials are repetitive even though I have gone throgh it already. Keeps on telling me that an error was encountered, no internet services, etc. i have a stable and fast internet connection! Also, now I cannot enroll my bank for easier transaction? It keeps on saying that the enrollment has expired, etc etc. Fix your service!","618130":"Can you take some action fixing the error, the bugs, detecting unsecure system?! It's been annoying since they pop up. I start liking it now because of it's \"CONVENIENCE\" thing but look. More bugs appear, I hope the developers take some action. PLUS, I ordered visa card and I only use it once, and the second time I withdraw money it says \"Transaction Unsuccessfull.\" I hope it will be fix asap.","618605":"It's stressful. My patience is at its peak. It always says \"The system detected...\" It thst my phone is not secured and it pissis me off. Like how many times it will pop up and close the app especially when I'm buying load. I need to do that from the start again then when I'm going to finish loading, it pops again. I hope you resolve this problem. My account and phone is already secure and I don't know why is it still popping. Grrr","619720":"Surprisingly, it still works on a rooted device \ud83d\ude43","619812":"The verification for me was fast, I took only 2 attempts. Update the app wont open up. Its a hassle and the more you use this app the more faulty the system is. This is very upsetting. Update: It's worse now. I can't even open the app it keeps on crashing. It's a hassle because I have to cash out money to buy things. This is frustrating.","619855":"The decision to block android devices with developer options are a huge issue as many use it to increase the animation speed expecially for lower spec devices. The developer options also pose no threat or issues on its own. If you need to block it, just block OEM unlocked devices. Will be switching to Maya.","620018":"The recent update to the GCash app has been a letdown, especially in terms of system performance. The app now lags and stutters, making the user experience frustrating. Despite having a secure device, the app falsely claims insecurity, raising concerns about its reliability. The previous version was a testament to simplicity, speed, and helpful features. However, the current version falls short in comparison. It's evident that the changes made have negatively impacted the overall usability.","620251":"Always a problem with this app. Dumb UI that won't let me submit needed requirements for verification (even if I was told to send them), times where I would be logged out of my own account for 'protection' which can by bypassed by restarting my phone, no consistent way of verification and always different between users. Absolutely dumb way to run an app. The only reason it even gets used - is because we have no other choice. Fix your app","620561":"I give it 4 stars. For me, this app is important especially in money transaction - sending and receiving. Secured, trusted, and good for saving money. The only thing I don't like this app, is #1 sometimes its laggy, specifically when I buy load it takes time to show options even though my network is good, #2 app is updating: troubleshooting sometimes, more time to wait, it give stress especially when you need your money badly, lastly, #3 Some promo of load is gone, dunno why. But all is good!","621226":"I really wish they would improve the app. Most of the time, I need to reboot it because an error keeps popping at the loading screen. I also needed to disable biometrics login because that caused the app to disappear altogether from my phone. Accessing your full transaction history is also a pain because they email it to you and it takes a while to compile. Weird how you can just view your full history in one page even on banking apps but not with this one. C'mon, GCash. Invest more in UX\/UI.","621541":"I love GCASH because it is very convenient most especially for transferring money, sending and receiving money. The good thing is friendly user. Gcash is that it provides a convenient and secure way to manage and transfer money using a mobile device. Users can easily send and receive money, pay bills, buy load, and even invest using the Gcash app. It also offers cashless transactions, allowing users to make purchases at partner merchants without the need for physical cash.","621617":"Still a garbage. Unreliable when needed. Had to link my bank thousand times because it gets removed everytime for no reason.","621826":"I would still give it 5 stars because of it's fast and reliable transactions. However, I hope gcash fix the error that I'm experiencing. Sometimes its still bothering me that somehow I couldn't access my account because of it's security problem but all in all it's good.","622237":"Okay there's a slight improvement with opening the app. But I don't want all of your tutorials everytime I wanted to open a new email in gcash inbox!! You're blocking it by forcing us to click on \"discover\" for easy email access when in fact I don't need that tutorial!!!???","622907":"I like this app because easy and quick to use and send and receive money the only I don't like. The only one thing I don't like is the profile limit that you can't send or receive money above 100,000. So, if you want to upgrade your limit you need to do a lot of task, it so hustle unlike the other app is so easy to upgrade your limit. You just need to fill up the savings even you don't deposit they will upgrade your limit.","623343":"It has been more than a WEEK, since I verified my account. I've been waiting for so long, because I had a pre-ordered I was ordering. It's either I screenshoted my ID blurry, or its the apps system. But still, that's not the only problem. I needed to make a new one because it DID NOT load my account back as I was trying to get in. I wasn't even verified that time yet.","623479":"I'm disappointed with the app's performance and the quality of services provided. I encountered several technical issues that affected my ability to use the app effectively. In an effort to troubleshoot the issue, I have taken the following steps; reinstalled the GCash app on my device, ensured that my device is not in developer mode, and used a root checker to verify that my device is not rooted.Despite these efforts, I am still encountering the error message related to jailbreaking or rooting","624185":"I've been facing challenges with the GCash verification process as none of my attempts have been successful. Despite providing all the necessary information they requested, my account verification has been repeatedly declined. Additionally, the app is disappointing as it lags a bit, even though my device is stable. The experience has been quite frustrating, so I'll definitely rate this 1 star.","625071":"1. It's hard to raise a ticket especially for non-techy people. You can't reach them via phone call 2. Transaction on RFID always fail. It happened to me twice. The help center is too slow to respond. I need the load to enter the expressway and they caused me too much inconvenience adding they inaccessibility. Worst service.","625163":"Although very convenient, even after the pandemic, its still overloaded with TOO MUCH. Too much ads, too much tutorials, too much \"fat\" in the app. At least have an option to turn all these other things off to have a faster and lighter gcash experience. Also lessen the amount of icons on the screen and clean it up significantly. Im only 20 and seeing everything on screen all at once makes me want to throw up.","625263":"Edit comment thank you for update regarding my concern however please let your gcash user know that there is an update to your app. We're waisting time and data to wait on *loading* but you never let us know that we need to update our app. Tssk","625676":"Wag kang update ng update gcash, log out kp ng log out!!! nkkadelay k ng trabaho... booo sitttt... Your just making it worse... Changing the procedures in every operation from time to time is such a big disturbance, learning it how and how over and over again that make some of the operations gone failed especially on buying load... If you upgrade the app make sure it works perfectly well because this app involves money. So, make it a completely reliable... Update ng update lalo naman bumabagal!","626090":"It useful and very essential to everybody who use it because it helps us to do easily send Money to our love ones very helpful apps to everyone and in thankful for this apps I can easily send money and received money from everywhere even in abroad you can easily send and receive money so this apps it's useful is very consistent I hope it will work more better than we expect if you have any problem with this apps you can easily ask them to help you to fix your problem and they will answer you and","626165":"I wish that there isn't a pop up ad everytime I open the app. It's so annoying!!! Specially if I'm just paying. I waste time trying to close it, or if I accidentally tap on it, it will redirect me. And if I am at a spot where the data isn't strong then I waste precious time. So annoying!","626608":"This app is so annoying. Seriously. It keeps crashing, keeps kicking me out the app for no apparent reason. The screen is always black unless it actually loads, which takes a long time. It's really hard to work with this app. Talk about slow, and chaotic. This app is really testing my patience.","627050":"Please improve security.","627965":"Might as well give it a one. I'm having problem since Last year about verifying my account. Atleast it would accept my Only valid Id (National Id) but always rejected by saying IT'S BLUR EVEN THO IT'S NOT. It always happen every month I try, and everytime I attempt to scan it, thrice until it reaches it limits, always ended up the same way. I need it for my allowance. Im studying far away from my hometown and supposedly, this app could help me. I will change this rate once my account is verified","628384":"Upon initial attempts to register my account, I encountered difficulty as the system was unable to detect the image of my ID. Despite numerous subsequent efforts to rectify the situation, I was met with a message indicating that I had exceeded the allowable number of attempts. Disappointingly, this issue persisted even after a span of several days had passed.","629037":"I give 4 only because everytime i open the apps it keeps unrecognized by the phone. Ir keep updating. This is nice apps but sometimes makes me irritable due to so many updates or bugs maybe in my phone.","629261":"I'm still verifying my account for the 7th time! My PayMaya account verification usually takes just 24 hours, and they usually accept it quickly. I followed all the necessary steps and even watched many verification videos on YouTube, so I know how to do it. But I don't understand why there's a problem with your verification process. It's so frustrating.","629529":"No customer service. Maya is better.","630090":"It's convenient to use, but it takes too long and to much to load. It always has an update that last for days before you're able to open it and be back to it's normal state. And lastly, there are always errors that are appearing, everytime you open it. And like, it won't work and you can't open it for days (you won't know whether it from an update because there are no prior notice).","630142":"If there was a 0 star option, I wouldn't even hesitate to choose that one. System is trash, even the verification process is too much of a hassle, it can't even scan a picture properly, bad customer service, or should I say, no customer service. Too many ads, maybe work on how to optimize the customer experience first before working on ads, the developers of this app sure is money faced, you don't care about anyone using this app as long as they're using it cause they're forced to","630164":"I'm disappointed with the newly updated version of this app. I encountered several technical issues that affected my ability to use the app. Although this is very convenient to use but I have been experiencing problems, especially when I verify my account. I always got failed. I hope that the developer will be used to a root checker to verify that my device is not rooted. Fix some bugs of this app.","630609":"It keeps on updating, crashing, sometimes you cant even open it, sometimes its will just kick you out even when your still using it. It keeps updating but not for a good reason coz i dont see any thing that has been improve, it just keeps on getting worse instead. Is your definition of updating your app is to lessen the service quality? LOL","630983":"despite a number of attempts, the app does not open and \u201c securing environment \u201d signals is still ongoing. And how many times do I have to update this app? Even after finishing the app update, a new pop up warning will again begin,that the app still needed an update. Too much adds keeps popping everytime if i tap something in the app.","631114":"Gcash your service is poor. You are focus more on how you can earn and get money from your customers but your app constantly loads forever. Now I can even buy load because its just blank white screen that just loading your useless app.","631283":"This app is not accessible using free data anymore. The update is \ud83d\udc4e. Login and telling that my device is not secured. And there are some bugs in apps. Whenever I try to load my self for a promo (swiping horizontally). Gcash keep telling me that you detected that my device I am using is not secured. How come?? I can access regular load only ~","634328":"Works fine BUT when I reset my phone and reinstall gcash, it required me to register to their new 'account secure' which allows only one device to access your account. So... What if you lose your phone? Lose your money too? Sounds like a nightmare. You have to unregister and then re register a phone on login. Make this thing OPTIONAL because it's inconvenient and impractical!","634506":"Don't dare to command us to turn off the developer option. Since that setting is supposed to be on if there are option there that need to be turned on especially for me, I need to enable the wifi and data to be turned on at the same time for faster internet connection. Also, there are a lot of settings there that are very helpful. Don't put this kind of feature, it's very annoying. Turning on this setting has nothing to do with GCash at all for most users. Be like other online banks!","634574":"It was all well and great experience, a fully verified user and it was really great. Unfortunately the app always asks for updates on your end and it's frustrating to keep updating to which I haven't done anything to keep them from asking. Also to that, customer service is a scam, money got lost, tried to ask for immediate help amd to mu surprise the damned case was dishonored, didn't even replied to my emails anymore. GCash should be doing actions with the money that has been lost, what a scam","635323":"There are a lot of functions and it has a user-friendly interface that may be helpful for people who hates complex structure. Everything about it are functioning except for the features that are not yet developed. Now commenting on the bad reviews about bad image scanning and bugs. It might be their device that are malfunctioning or it's either the fact that they have an old device that are not compatible for the latest features due to the newly released updates. Overall, it's effecient for all.","635416":"This app isn't a satisfactory service. Although, all features including online transactions are accessible, but overall experience becomes useless. Customer service doesn't help when they're not human\/robot-like questions. They don't have free vouchers to other users unlike other apps have. Security is tight, but poor balance. I'll switch another app if there's no 0 at all.","635497":"it keeps on crashing. I've been trying to use 'express send' for over an hour and I can't get pass even typing the number. it always goes back to my home screen making me start the process again. uts frustrating since this app was supposed to be convenient. Edit: Its been more than 2 hours and I still cant send a single cent. Aren't you alarmed that I have to ask OTPs multiple times because of your \"authentication process??\"","635798":"So disappointing Don't dare to command us to turn off the developer option.

Turning on this setting has nothing to do with GCash at all for most users.","636455":"Gcredit and ggives are now useless.","636835":"Bank cash-in is unavailable when i need it the most. Ridiculously unreliable! Turning off Developer Options doesn't justify the level of security the app can provide. Not user-friendly. Too much bloat and unnecessary app guide and how-tos. Not to mention the overwhelmingly endless list of buttons. Waste of time, energy and data. ABSOLUTELY NOT VERY CONVENIENT TO USE AT ALL!","636926":"It was great, but the app's reliability and security is deteriorating currently. It takes almost 4 hours before the receipt or the transactions shows on the history. Additionally, the app is under maintenance for long and numerous times. I am hoping that this would be improved and the app would go back the way it is before. Due to the face recognition app , we weren't able to recover the money under our auntie's account too lol.","637058":"This app is fine and is quite important for things regarding finance and was pretty good a long time a go, now it is much more terrible. My issues are, is that it is quite buggy, especially when opening the app, it crashes alot, and the fact that I couldn't use developer options. I'd like to be able to use developer options because it gives me different options for things I need to do that requires it, but due to its strange device security error, it is not possible for me to use it.","637237":"Overall annoying to use: app goes on maintenance every week; customer service agents are SUPER unhelpful; gives tutorials every so often even though I've been a user for 5 years now; never uses biometrics login even though i have it set to ENABLED; I don't receive emails for certain bills payments even though I set an email (contacted support; they of course, didn't help at all); contacts list page for send money ALWAYS causes the app to crash; cant even list all my complaints here! Yer welcome!","637242":"Still giving it a 1 star if Google dors jave a zero star I would do it. Your verification process is okay now, but what's not okay is I can't open it.

Originally didn't want to use this app but no choice since its the most available online payment method in my local area. Like what other users wrote down, beautifying it should be the LEAST of your priorities. What you need to change is its easy accessibility as well as its speed when opening the app. Imagine taking 5-8 minutes (yes I counted) just to open the app and it didn't even include the time it took to verify the payment.","637682":"It seems that registering the app to one phone is counter productive in my experience. What if my fingerprint does not always work on the phone I'm using while the app is registered to my relatives' phone which is not always available? Or what if my registered phone is defective and suddenly broke but i have no back up phone? The registering of phones seem to cause a lot more problems rather than solutions so far. Sadly","637763":"Opening the app itself is already making a fuss, delayed pop up or delayed menu. Now the \"Load\" option itself is not opening when you open it. It literally takes minutes or sometimes you even have to close\/open the app to use the feature, and still delayed. And that Developer Option thing is irritating the hell out of most the users. FIX IT ALL","639080":"It's a good and convenient app for payment and money transaction but you need to update it almost from time to time which is a hassle especially because it's eating a lot of memory on the phone. Edited: this is getting more and more infuriating! Many bugs and loading app plus you need to update everytime and it's not even improving! The updates are useless!","639108":"Couldn't access my account using internet connection with my current internet provider(ST). I have to switch to data connection or a different provider just so i can log in. Wrote them a letter about this but after checking, they already marked it as SOLVED without even informing me why this happened and how to address the issue.","641112":"I wanted to update my account information specifically the address. But everytime I did - the new address I provide only gets concatenated with the existing address. and it's not even easy to update info because it's like going through the verification process all over again everytime. I know it's for security purposes but do I have to take selfies and provide ID photo everytime I update my address that the app is not even updating successfully. My address is messed up now.","642857":"it is very laggy. time-consuming since it takes much more than expected time to open the app because it keeps on lagging and restarting even though our internet doesn't have issues. it also keeps on saying that 'Please retry later' when all I have to do is to send money. thus, it will make me try it again later because it has a feature that you cannot send the same amount to the same number for the reason that it can be repeated. but what if the user is intentionally doing it?\ud83e\udee4","643250":"This is for getting SB19 as ur cover page in the app. Now I'm always smiling despite the expenses\/payment I make thru the app. Haha.

Can't open the app. It says they are fixing things. It's always like this whenever I need it the most. It's either this or my linked banks often becomes unlinked just days without using it. This is terrible. Very inconvenient. It shouldn't even get offline as people always need it for finances. Terrible app.","644664":"Ano ba? Face verification? Is this really needed if the Phoenix number is secured and registered along with the account? What if complications arise that make this impossible? Pahamak tong mga developers.","645190":"I hate your update. I can't even use the app properly since it keeps on crashing and going on and on about device security. I tried turning off the developer option but it still did not work. I can't even send money or use the app for load. The money is just stuck there due to the app being literally unusable. I'm cashing it all out and never using this trash app again. The reason why I use e-wallet is for convenience and this is far from it. Fix this or you'll continue losing users.","645378":"Step up your game This gets a 1 star rating from me because no matter how hard I try to reset my mpin with the otp it always makes the message \"something went wrong\" appear. Even if the right code was put in. My developer options are off, ive turned off the downloads in my chrome browser. The app wont open on the first try and the experience is just bad overall.","645628":"The app keeps on closing on itself and keep on telling me that \"Our system has detected that the device you are using is not secure\" and then it closes on its own. I followed all the steps from the gcash help center, and yet it doesn't function the way I expected it. It happens most of the time and it's UPSETTING and INCONVENIENT. It only allowed me to use the app once I have my phone undergo factory reset. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!","645762":"very disappointing, too many updates but no improvement, still laggy and app crashes all the time, it takes too long opening or using the app whether you are using mobile data or wifi.","645791":"I recently used this app, and the overall experience left much to be desired. The app's sluggish performance made simple transactions a time-consuming ordeal. Navigating through its interface was inconvenient, causing unnecessary delays. To add to the frustration, frequent error messages disrupted the flow, making it unreliable and challenging to trust with important transactions. Improvement is crucial for a smoother user experience.","646106":"I tried verifying my account but the system keeps insisting that the number of the ID in the photo does not match the info in the fill up. I tried correcting it because the system detected \"S\" as number \"5\" and when I try to submit it, it does not allow me because the system wants me to follow the wrong ID number instead of the correct one just because it's what the system recognized. I can't even submit a ticket for this because the help center is not even available. Terrible experience.","647385":"The app is becoming more and more unreliable, inconvenient, and sluggish. They're now slowly being outpaced by their competitors when it comes to performance, accessibility, security, and convenience. If it's not for their international payment system, I would've completely left the brand.","648145":"The app would be great, but I just can't verify my account using my Philippine ID. It's so frustrating trying over and over again so many times and the result is all the same whenever I scan the back of my ID it keeps on saying to try again because the photo is unclear which obviously were very fine since it just confirmed the front of the ID. Then as I keep on trying i keep in reaching the maximum attempts, and brings me back to square one. I hope this could be fixed.","648650":"I click on the app and it does nothing anymore so I can't access\/open my account, It used to work properly, but now it's just an app that has my money that I can't get into, because of their constant updates!!!

But they are good at removing my rating\/comments about this issue rather than fixing my issue","648877":"Just today. I can't open the app. I was on the counter ready to pay.

Before I don't believe it but now that it's almost a week that my money was lost and was not credited back to my account and their help centre couldn't help at all. It was all nonsense using the ticket where there's no update at all! I lost 4,000 pesos which I badly needed at this very difficult time and haven't heard anything from them! May we all stop using this app and use the bank instead!!","650684":"Hope there is an option wherein if you cant use face verification then there are other ways to open your account or atleast add a feature where you can add another trusted person to your account Its hard when you are sharing the account to a family member and then suddenly it will require me to verify by face recognition which I can't for we are apart long distances... Very inconvenient","651322":"Not so good sometimes but because of this app it can be easily to make payments and bills with gcash app","651810":"Used to be good because it's fast and reliable. One tap and the app opens. Now, I need to multi-tap, and wait for eternity if it will open or not. If it does open, I will be flooded with a mountainload of ads that I do not have the time nor care to paybattention to. Have done everything from forced stopping and reinstalling, but nothing changed. I need it to be fast and reliable as it used to be.","651819":"This app deactivated my active account, and its very hassle to transfer my old account to the new account i have made and it is taking very long to follow up. The service quality is very poor. I hope when they are creating apps like this, they should be ready for any upcoming problems with their apps and the customers are suffering from the problems that they didn't even consider to happen before creating the app. Very disappointing.","651891":"You have my words for the excellent service!! but I only have a couple of concerns and suggestions relating to the improvement of the app; it's a bit laggy on the home page, I think it is because of the overloaded inbox. May I suggest to make a selection where we can select all or an specific in that inbox and delete. And also to lessen the ads and promotion on the home page everytime I logged in to my account, its like I hear my mom calling me every seconds, it crashes my ear.","652132":"The feature of Face Verification is so annoying. I tried multiple devices with such GOOD CAMERA, A well lighted room but still, steady face but still, unable to make a face verification. How the hell does this security feautures works? Fix this, so damn annoying, can't use GCash for in case of emergency and in need of cash transfer because of this feature.","652456":"I only use this out of necessity. Terrible experience otherwise. Incredibly sluggish. Annoying pop ups. I sent a support ticket completely detailing an issue I'm having and what I have done to self troubleshoot. I guess CS didnt read anything that I sent them because I only got a cookie cutter response email with troubleshooting steps that I have already done and more. And the fact that you have your users turn off developer mode is awful. Overall bad design. Such a let down from a telecom giant","652721":"Really GCash?At some point you're making so hard for your users to be terribly dissatisfied getting a simple issue to resolved. I lost my phone of course together with the sim. No one wishes to be in that situation. I reported it immediately to avoide unauthorize transaction. There you go,my account was on hold as easy as that without even notifying me via sms or email. When I got the replacement physical sim. I submitted everything you needed, TERRIBLE APAKABAGAL MARESOLVED! ILANG ARAW NA!","652798":"It used to be good since it's convenient and reliable. But after all those useless updates, it's already a hassle. I can't open my account as it states that it needs to have an updated android server. I have the latest android server update. And now I can't open it anywhere else because of the registered phone policy. Maya doesn't have issues like this. Will opt for Maya in future transactions.","653209":"So stressful when the app suddenly freezes or crashes while you're in the middle of paying. I've heard people getting deducted but the payment not going through, and they never got their money back. How can we use this app when we're scared everytime we use it? It's an app that holds our money, so please fix it. Yes it's helpful, it's convenient, but please understand we need it to be stable. So weird to have a mobile wallet that you don't trust with your money. Even gforest isn't working well.","653864":"The app is still full of bugs and glitches. Whenever I tries to open the Help Center and check the status of my ticket, the app keeps closing, there's always an error prompt saying that I have been log out. Their process' still a hassle and takes too long to resolve the issues. I'm quite disappointed that nothing has ever changed ever since.","654025":"I regret to say that my experience with this app has been extremely disappointing. The user interface is clunky and unintuitive, making it a struggle to navigate through the various features. The app is riddled with bugs and glitches, causing frequent crashes and freezing. Furthermore, the content available on the app is severely lacking in quality and variety. Overall, I would not recommend this app to anyone looking for a reliable and enjoyable user experience. Customer Service is nonsense","654151":"So buggy. Whenever I can't even log in to my account anymore because it says \"Sonething went wrong. Learn how to troubleshoot or try again after an hour\". Really how about updating your app to fix this bug rather than adding more ads. The fact that it says \"learn how to troubleshoot\" adds more fuel to the fire, really an inconvenient app, as time goes by it gets much worse. 0 stars for you if there is.","655036":"It would have been nice If you have a separate or lite version of the current gcash app. A version that only cater immediate transactions like send money and the likes excluding other functions like invest, games and etc that is not from what I think most people would use. It's annoying for it to crash or hang up most of the time. And yeah maybe this is due to my phone that is not so High End having low RAM but I am just posting this just in case if possible to have a lighter version.","655103":"This is very disappointing. I was enjoying the app for a good while but then it suddenly doesn't work anymore? I have indeed tried what it says in the help center and even talked with their ai about what to do numerous times and it's just the same instructions over and over and it still hasnt been fixed. I can't log in, I've done what it has told me to. I need the money inside. Please fix your troubleshooting. I'll change the review if I manage to retrieve back my account. This is outrageous.","655406":"Please bring back the normal transition when making transactions. The slow sliding\/fading effect looks cheap and not organic.","655447":"GCash Card handling is not impressive, even the courier, no contact at all. When Help->Conversation always log out my account, it sucks!","655741":"Edit: The new update makes more hassle can't login or complicated login procedure changing the way it already an supposedly easy login process to a more hassle also whenever connected using Wi-Fi, also UI very much lagging sloppy. What if you're in an area like mountains and the only internet source is through Wi-Fi with strong connectivity then transactions will be failure. What if I switch phone or issues with previous phone then all my money will hold in the process and hard to access.","656080":"App is so laggy, I've tried to use different devices with different internet connection but it's so slow to use. Whenever I tried to send money or load, I often get an error that transaction cannot be done then after some time when I retry, the supposed 1 transaction doubles. The support was not really helpful, it's so hard to get in touch with a live agent, I was promised to receive an SMS update about my account, up til now I still haven't received any. Please do better.","656105":"Photos wouldn't do it justice. Experiencing the eclipse, in the moment, being present, was one of the most calming, blissful experiences I've had. I can think back to being a kid and experiencing something and having the memory of it, not the record or picture of it. Think about the times when photos and smartphones weren't even a thing. People had to BE THERE to experience things. From these experiences, we shared stories, and descriptions and even wrote songs and poems about them. The connecti","656355":"So many issues and very slow customer service response rate. You haven't fixed your gloan problems even with the update? your gigi help centre is not working (I get logged out everytime I try to use it). Now you are asking us to update our profile information. You force us to fill up the Proof of Billing, but what if we don't have any proof of billing because we don't have any bills to pay to begin with? This should be optional! We can't even upload a file or image, forcing us to use our camera!","656803":"It's been two weeks already and I still could not login. It's always \"Something went wrong. Learn how to troubleshoot or try again after an hour.\" I already reported this before on the second day of the incident and their response was try the troubleshoot and login again. I did the troubleshoot but still could not login. I also clicked the Help Center now but it suddenly closed, indicating the something went wrong. My phone is still in good condition but this app is no longer working.","657006":"Tutorial every log in. OTP when paying via QR takes years so imagine the pressure with the queue behind you. Favorite billers are not getting saved. Preferred bank for cash in always gets removed - both favorite and the link itself. Processing fee on everything lol","657367":"Must there be an error message that something went wrong everytime I open the app for the first time everyday? Also, you know what happens when you pop up an ad everytime your app is opened? It becomes automatic to click the \"Remind me later\" button without ever reading the ad. I don't remember the last time I read your ad. You might as well put a \"Never remind me\" button. Actually, there really should be a \"Never remind me\" button.","657432":"authentication code when sending money takes forever to receive. almost every move you do, there's a code. i know you value security but at least have give us an option to authenticate transactions using biometrics like any other apps. plus every time you click on something, there will be unskippable tutorial. not very user friendly. took me about 20 mins to receive code.","658805":"It was good at first, then there are problems with the biometric login, repeated maintenance, ghost transactions, delayed transfers.","659175":"I've been experiencing a trouble logging in for example of the error \"something went wrong........try again after an hour\" something like that and base of what I've read to the feedbacks . It was really the same error I have been encountering it's. Been 3 days since the experience I hope you will have proper troubleshooting in your app development side as UX.","659816":"It improves a lot. My account is secured however the recent security update is quite annoying. I can't make any transactions without completing such procedure, I mean I've complied a lot of times but it just won't work.","660129":"I'd there's a 0 star option I will rate this app 0 stars. I've been trying to open this app and it won't even open. My screen is just black when I try to open it. Then if I did open it and try to send money. It will turn off and log out by it self then ask for an update. I update this app two times in a row and nothing happened. I already restart my phone to see if something could happen. But still don't open. It's just keep going black and logging out itself. Please fix this.","661477":"I've been trying to cash in from PayPal but it just kept on showing an error prompt since yesterday. I have linked my PayPal to GCash and has been cashing in and yet this time it just won't push through.","661631":"All in all functional for it's intended purpose, but too bloated to give it a 5 star. Pros: bugs I are few amd far between. Cons: very aggressive and annoying upselling of other services (insurance etc.) which are checked ON by default! UI is intended to be useful and easy but is the opposite. Settings (favorites, saved banks etc.) are reset after update.","662745":"If you haven't verified and you're trying to resolve it right now, don't even bother. Their AI chatbot \"Gigi\" is so damn useless a faded street sign outclasses it. You can't even make your own ticket without having to navigate through their mess of a menu. Their email address is useless too. Why did they even bother making one if all the response you'll get is from an AI that can't even go out of the preset messages. Customer service is non-existent. Find another e-transaction app.","662765":"Undescribably frustrating! Always being prompted with Attempt Limit reached when I try to verify my account. The setup is already good and very readable. Even the apps scanner prompted 'perfect'.","662924":"I am once again locked out of my account because of the stupid selfie verification. Even before, I have tried various lighting positions and distance from my face to the camera on my phone but it still won't verify me. I have been using the same phone and I'm the only one who has access to this phone. It seems that its \"verification\" system does not have a way to \"verify\" itself. It will be wiser to use other e-wallets with simple system checkers BUT SURPRISINGLY, HAS LESS FRAUDULENT USERS.","662937":"Horrible. There's always a problem when I try to open it. With the face verification, no matter how many times I try, it doesn't recognize. I've fixed lightning, followed instructions and all, but no use. Plus, whenever I try to access the help center, it's bugged again. It's annoying. Why can't we have the option to have less security used? I mean, is the pin not enough? We should at least have a choice to remove the face verification thing. It kept on bugging \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e","663081":"I payed through scanning a qr code and a certain amount was deducted to my balance but it did not reflect in my transaction history and the merchant did not received any transaction. I also cannot raise a ticket about it cause everytime i fill out the transaction id with N\/A cause it's not on my transaction history, it always says it is invalid. Pls fix your app, a lot of people are using it. It has so many updates, yet it is so full of bugs and glitches. PS 11 days Still ddnt get my money back","663084":"Problems: 1) annoying ad popup every single time you open the app 2) can't change registered mobile number 3) cashing in from bpi works 1% of the time 4) there are fees now just for cashing in??? There are literally other apps that do exactly the same thing and are more convenient than this garbage. Suggestion: if you won't let us change the registered number, at least give the option to add one.","663228":"It's so annoying. I can't open the account because of the face recognition. It keeps saying time out even though the light is well lit and in good position. I cant even go to help center to submit ticket because it keeps saying there's a problem or whatsoever. I still have balance there and I can't even withdraw that when I needed it because of this face recognition. Why can't you just remove it? I hope you'll do something to fix this as soon as possible.","663288":"I been trying to verify multiple times in the app and the last time that I attempted to do that was weeks ago and still verifying. I tried to reachout to your gigi AI chat but it is so useless as error pops out every time i click it. I guess this app is getting useless as many of your users are having a worse time while using this. Some of them lost a half of thier money when system maintenance happened and y'all don't know where their money is.","663351":"Recently forced into \"Account Secure\". I have 2 phones, business and personal, and I usually only bring one. This system doesn't consider us at all, at least allow us to register 2-3 devices, you have facial recognition on registration after all. I could work around the occasional OTP issue (just send a message to someone at home to check it on my main phone) but this just completely ignores users with multiple phones.","663588":"I am editing my previous review and deducting two stars since the app sucks now. It became the worst of all versions since 2018\/2019 editing again today since the app decided that i need to verify my acct again even though i am already fully verified since 2018\/2019","663881":"This app before is very convenient and open quickly without using any data charges,but now it become more hassle and it's not that accessible any time you want to. The features crashed and every week there's a recommendation for an update. Now, for me it was getting into my nerves and it's not convenient, it only shows loading and unloading. Ugh it was time consuming to log in at all.","663969":"What's wrong with this app?? So many updates. It seems like everytime I'm using it I have to update the app. It's really frustrating!","664267":"Thank you very much for the very helpul application that has a widest financial services coverage that give me an ease to access my payments, fund transfer, savings and many more. The app is interlinked to many financial institution, in addition the application also help me to have a financial reach to my family, my friends and so on... Keep it up two thumbs up...","664525":"Installed the latest update and all of a sudden my account needed verification before I can do transfers. The F, Globe?! I had to resubmit data they ALREADY SHOULD HAVE and wait for them to approve the verification! What are the updates for, really? Binebenta niyo ba data ng customers niyo?","664526":"App now is slow and buggy unlike before. Verification process is hassle, can't even capture a photo nicely. (Edited) I gave 1 star!!!! If there's 0 star, I will rate it zero! My account was back from fully verified to basic - so my funds are on hold. Lol! They didn't even notified me via text! I'm done and not using this anymore. Super hassle and inconvenient to use!!!!!!! Will switch to their competitor app.","664615":"The security features of this app is very glitchy and wouldn't allow me to log in to my account, it should be optional for users to turn off face recognition, especially with those who have the index scanner on. Speaking of face recognition, no matter how much i position myself to have my face scanned, it still wouldn't allow and results in an error, after multiple retry, the app prevents me from face scanning anymore by kicking me out all the time.","665051":"Am I the only one who experienced mya account being verified for more than 2 years already but then suddenly it became a basic account without any reason at all. I had to verify my account again but it's taking ages to have it verified again. As a result I can't transfer the money contained in my account. Can someone fix this especially if it's a glitch!!!!","665147":"I updated the app today. And my account was log-out. Now I can't log in again. It repeatedly ask for selfies then there's always an error message when trying to enter PIN. I've been using the app for a long time and everytime there's an update, there are additional new bugs\/error. So frustrating when you needed online transactions immediately. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e","665374":"Year 2019 I already rated this app but only 3 stars because during that time I cannot update my email as well as the verification. but this year I am very grateful in this app for it is really helpful for me especially this time of pandemic. I rated this app 5 stars but then something happened. I submitted tickets but their is no actions being taken to fixed the issue. So, I will be rating this to 1. I will rate this 5 if the issue will be solved.","665434":"The interest rates are getting higher and higher. They take away your advantages despite being a good payer and never being late just because you're not using their services enough. Seems like they've gotten worse and greedier. App is buggy, UI sucks. You're better off using SeaBank, Maya, or GoTyme. QR Ph also works for them and they have higher interest points in their savings.","665542":"I was skeptical to use at first but became impressed with the ease of wireless transaction service locally. Update on April 2024: Kind suggestion to have an option NOT to update the app right away. There are many times either I have low connectivity or low battery and it's such a hassle to do an update in pronto with no option to bail out. Also, I hope service maintenance will be done in early mornings rather than middle of the day.","667007":"Why always having updates?! I don't see any difference","667059":"it would have been better if you lessen the security when transferring to a new phone. my old phone swam in a bucket full of water and you keep asking to unregister it from my old phone. plus i cant find where to submit that damned ticket, it keeps asking to go to profile, i couldn't even get in. im to the bones furious and hungry. my allowance is in my account. hence, the one star. please fix it also your help center isnt helping, it keeps on saying error occured.","667147":"So frustrating. I have been trying to fix my issue but until right now nothing's happening. Their customer service is useless, all of it is an automation. It can't really help me as my issue is different. Its always asking me to register my phone, then I'll take a selfie, and after that it will just redirect me to the page saying \"Yes, register this phone\" then nothing happens. My money is stuck and I can't do anything. So disappointing.","667151":"The app is helpful as I use this to pay bills and transact work-related payment. However, I updated the app today and my account went back to being a \"basic account\". I am no longer verified. It is so hassle because I NEED to send and I HAVE transaction related to my work that I need to do today. This kind of update causes delay and I don't understand why the previous verified account will be returned to basic account.","667396":"It's essential tool. But too many updates, we cannot use it without updating. The update is more often, i cannot use it for transaction because of its update and annoyingly its eating every internet data when I'm not connected in our wifi when updating. Can you update it once or twice a year..","667498":"On every update requires you to set up your account all over again (sending again valid ID, additional infos, and selfie). Worst part, you'll have to wait for 7 days to get the confirmation. You are not able to send out money or load because you have to wait for your account to be verified. Honestly, I could not find significant changes on every update except it gets glitching than before. Online payments were supposed to be more efficient and convenient to use. This was not it.","668710":"Very poor service. Edited my review from 5 stars to 1 star becaue of my bad experience with the app. I used to rely to GCash on a daily basis until I was affected by the sudden \"re-verification\" process. My account was downgraded to Basic. Instead of admitting they had an issue with their system, they keep on giving lame excuses and even blame it on the user. Customer support always give templated response. Time to transfer to other e-wallet. I don't want to experience the hassle and stress.","668774":"It has been almost a month now that i can't open this app due to the face recognition interface that brings me back to the MPN and biometrics. I literally can't access your services to report this as there is an error popping up. My money is frozen and this app doesn't work anymore. Before the update it was working just fine and now simply opening the app takes forever. If there is zero star i will rate it.","669206":"I were fully verified before and have been using the app for years. Suddenly, my account got unverified for unauthorized log-in attempt of unknown (which ain't me). Now, my money is currently frozen since I've been prohibited from sending or withdrawing. The problem is that, the verification process is taking too long, they even got nerve to reply with my inquiry ASAP instead of expediting my verification. There are some other e-wallet with fast system processing and even GOT PHYSICAL STORE.","669881":"Gcash never fails to disappoint me, especially with their new update about registering your phone. It led me to do a face scan but it always shows failure, even after following the proper position within the frame and being well-lit, despite my attempts for days now! I did the troubleshooting but it got worse because I can no longer log in. Just great! They will not allow me to call them, and I am having a hard time reaching out to a live agent. Poor customer service!","669987":"There are too many updates which were unhelpful and just make things complicated. I cannot log-in on my gcash account because they are requiring a face scan. However, their face scanner is not working properly and it let me do it many times and all those tries were unsuccessful! \ud83e\udd2c My mpin also is not working so I tried to forgot the mpin, however their 6-digit code is not being sent to my email address. I don't know if I could open my gcash account again. I hope they return back the old version","670098":"The new face recognition doesn't even work. I've done it more than 10 times now. It still can't recognize me even though the circle progress thing is already at 100% edit: I got it to work but it took a lot of attempts. It is still a problem for almost 2,000 people those based on the one review that 1,800 people agreed on. Still need to be fixed.","670302":"It is now asserting that my device is \"not secure.\" I did everything I could think of, including deactivating developer settings, but it wasn't effective at all. This is a really terrible experience since it always, apparently at random, closes the app. This problem appears to be shared by a large number of other users. Please fix it as soon as possible as I was dealing with this for almost a month now. Still not working properly, worse is I have no unregister button in account secure!","670382":"Your app sucks beyond measure. It is not convenient anymore, because of useless updates and stupid security features. Now i can only access my account with only one phone, and i can't even register it because your stupid system is not able to verify my face recognition despite meeting all requirements. How am i supposed to Open my account with this","670438":"Good app, actually. I can transact with ease when it comes to loading or cash-in\/out. Although, I have my own complaint when it comes to constantly updating the app. Could somebody explain why the app is not usable without updating to the latest version? EDIT: Why another face scanning! As if the constant updating isn't enough, now this? I can't log in days later... and then when face scan is done, it later said AUTHENTICATION FAILED!!","670493":"The app is perfect already dear developer stop updating it. Higher version means higher storage, higher functionality and higher device requirements and consume a lot of means when it should only focus on cash in and out stop adding tons of games tons of adds and everything that makes it slow or bombarded thats what creates issue. It might seem friendly but everything is fair in love and war! What other wants is to drag your system down and replaced you on top. Stick to your edge and be content","670661":"My account is fully verified but this app added a feature called \"account secure\" that you need to do the face recognition but still after trying multiple times, I am still unable to get through it. It's time consuming and annoying at the same time.","670832":"I've been using this app for over a year. However, I kept encountering issues to cash-in. It just kept saying 'Oops unable to process transaction. Please try again later.' I've already done basic troubleshooting steps before to no avail. Sometimes, I would just encounter an internal server error. The developers should really keep an eye on their app.","670842":"May 1 still out of action no change since my post April 24. The service is unreliable. I have been unable to make payments for 60 hours. The message is check your internet. I am sending this, my internet works. I closed\/reopened the app, I turned the phone off\/on, I cleared the cache, uninstalled\/reinstalled the app, nothing works. This is the longest I've experienced this. This doesn't work.","671057":"Now I got new issues with the app, when I'm trying to pay my bills (and this happens with several billers, not just one) I just get error message \"invalid amount\" even I have enough load at my account. I have reinstalled the app, cleaned the data and cache, but the issue remains. Therefore I'm unable to pay my bills with the app. My phone is Samsung S24 Ultra.","671092":"No matter how fast your internet connection is, this stupid app just keeps taking its time loading things up specially when you want to buy load. You have to waste 30 minutes of your time just to buy load. It has been a great issue for a long time and I dont see any fixes to it. Which makes me think that the developers of this app are stupid.","671525":"Doesn't even open properly... This app worked before but with the recent updates, it's just black and crashes most of the time.","671583":"My husband's phone got damaged, now, we are having trouble signing in on a dif device since it's giving us error that phone is already reg to a dif device. ee went thru all the verification, however still needed to wait for your agent's email. very hassle. If this happens to older folks, they will no longer be able to access their account since most of them don't rmmber the email they used when creating the acc (my folks for example). Pls add a live support agent in ur app to expedite evrything","671872":"Worst experience ever! My gcash account was already fully verified, and I have done all the updates as needed then suddenly it went back to being basic, not fully verified! It took a couple days before account was fully verified again and I was unable to use the app for how many days!!! Just now, i transferred money on it then i could no longer pull it back up and just saying error! Argggh!","672101":"The only downside of this app is after the updates. It requires to enter the OTP or verification code that was sent to registered number. Seaman most of the time are in the middle of the ocean miles away from the nearest land, and no way to receive the OTP that was sent. There should be another way to receive the OTP or verification code, like the registered email. It costing us some delays and problems for paying our bills. I'm switching back to Maya. No hassle for loging in.","672359":"Gcash doesn't work after reinstall. The face recognition doesn't work, so I can't log back in at all anymore. When I try to use the HELP center I only get an error message. Nothing works.","672774":"Update: Now it forces users to choose ONE phone that can be used. What if it's lost, stolen or broken? Original review: Each time I log in, at least 2 pop-ups will appear. Sometimes more. Each one telling me about a promo or a feature. That's too many. Sometimes I just want to log in quickly and do a transaction. No need to remind me of this feature or that promo each fricking time. Also, the app is SLUGGISH on a midrange phone.","672804":"It's almost 2 weeks since I've been waiting for the bank transaction to work but it's still not working. It always says \"please try again\". And when sending money it always says check the internet connection when the internet is fine and has strong connection. This app is always requesting for an update but the problems are not even getting fixed. There's a lot of negative and one star review saying the same thing and no action is being done.","672890":"Horrible experience now, the app is inaccessible due to it constantly asking for verification. I understand that it's for security measures but it's gone up to the extreme that I would rather just pay up front than use this sorry excuse of an e-wallet. The many add-ons are already causing major traffic for lower end phones, instead of sticking to being a reliable alternative for payment, it's inconsistencies is tarnishing it's potential.","673089":"As time passes, this app deteriorates. Verification takes too long. My previous phone got damaged, that's why I transferred my SIM card to a new one. With all my bills and due dates, I can't use the funds in my account because it needs verification. My goodness, you need to pay to avoid interest but this app is so frustrating. It feels like it takes 48 years to verify.","673112":"I've exhausted all troubleshooting steps on my phone\u2014uninstalling suspicious apps, disabling developer options, ensuring the phone is unrooted, and disabling installation via untrusted sources. Despite using this since 2018, I can't access it by any means. PC Android emulators won't work either, and buying another device just for this purpose isn't a practical solution. To the software team in charge, it's frustrating that this issue persists. As of 05\/06\/24 crashes when logging the mpin.","673217":"1 star! I liked the app since it is easy to use and access to pay. Now I lost my sim and couldn't get back the 5500 PESOS for my college fee. Now I can't have a fully verified account because I only have a passport to verify my account. You didn't reply to my mail I sent! FOR STUDENTS OUT THERE BE CAREFUL IF YOU LOST YOUR SIM YOU CAN'T GET A REFUND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE IDS THEY KEPT ASKING TO FULLY VERIFY YOUR ACCOUNT","673854":"Buggy and bloated. Opening the app brings up a pop-up. There are times when it restarts the onboarding adding more of a hassle. The \"unsecure system\" alert disrupts application operations too much despite having a secure system active. Favorites are also always reset after a certain period. Aside from those mentioned are the various crashes, the lack of maintenance notices regarding its services, and the refusal to open after one tap of the app icon. Still unreliable and disappointing.","674047":"My sister needs to use my device for her account verification due to phone issues. However, after several attempts, we're unable to verify. Now, to proceed, they're asking to link her account to my device. -- so I thought that I can't switch my acc to other device but it seems like I can so yeah my problem is fine. Just hoping that the verification process will finally be verified.","674281":"Deceptive app. Gives you an option to choose if you want to insure or not your money transfer, but automatically toggles the insurance to \"yes\" before hitting send. If you're not fully aware of this, you would lose 30 pesos everytime you make a transfer. Globe does close to nothing about malicious transfers, scams, but asks users to pay an insurance fee.","674453":"Better switch to MAYA or other digital wallets. After the update, the app can't be opened unless the \"Developer Options\" is disabled on the phone. I have to turn this feature off everytime I try to open the GCash app. Fix this","675063":"Recently, this added security verification is very time consuming, really, frustrating. Yeah it is for add on security, but this is too much! It's really inconvenient for me, when i am doing transactions abroad, and my old phone got bricked! Yeah scams have become rampant, but general awareness of otp management should be enough. Then, when you go thru verification, it will take 24 to 48hrs?! What is that? Manual verification!? Nerves!","675233":"Since a few days ago they activated their face scan verification. It doesn't work obviously. So I'm locked out of the account. No support, just their useless garbage chat bot. Don't trust these people with your money.","676047":"Kindly help resolve the issue. This is really frustrating. Lagi na lang kayo error. I already updated the app. Uninstalled then re installed but what happened check wifi or data . Getting nowhere. I got strong internet connection. I cannot input my phone number to get the otp. Same error. Fix this issue please. A lot of peole are getting frustrated with the app. Hindi na sya user friendly.","676216":"I can't open my account due to my phone being \"unsecured\". I tried everything, uninstalled unsecured applications, developers option, cleared the cache, restarting my phone, reinstalling the app, and even my phone's security and whatnot. It still won't open, I tried to open my account in another phone, but darn it now it wants me to unregister my phone so that I can open my account on another phone. I can't even open the app on that registered phone damnit! Such a hassle!!!!!","676320":"If there's a zero star I would be happy to rate it zero. Your app just sucks , too many bugs and crashes. I've been trying to log in to my account by registering my phone but the face recognition doesn't work at all, like I've tried multiple times but it always takes me back to log in section over and over again, it's super frustrating and annoying. I really hope your app would be gone here on playstore and replaced it with a better banking and finance app with different developer.","676498":"Terrible app. I thought I am the only one having problem with the facial recognition feature. Many users are experiencing the same problem and they still didn't fix this issue. This is also not the first time I experience this problem. The customer service is also slow. I created a ticket and after 3 weeks of commicating via email there is still no solution. Proof of identity has been send and I still can't log in. It's better to put our money in other e-wallet platforms.","676790":"Very disappointing. I will not entrust my money on this app again. So many struggling process just to log in my acc. due to this new feature. I can't even have access to my own money the time I needed it most. The upgrade is not an upgrade at all. It's just pure inconvenience. What's the point of otp if I can't log in still? Frustrating.","677385":"If I am to rate this app, it should have been zero. Rated it one star, considering I've been using it for too long. You freeze my account with my money on it. Verification takes more than the said timeframe, 7 days. My ticket has been escalated twice! But yet no resolution was done. You always said it will take 24-48 hours for the escalation! Yet nothing has been done! And I have bills to pay and my money is in your account! Their chat option does not provide update! What a terrible experience!","677862":"I will change the rating once my issue is solve. I have contacted the customer support but no resolutions to my issue only system generated response. It's been a week since I wasn't able to use the app.I don't know with the current updates I just authenticated and registered my phone last week as requested by the app and now I have to do it again. It keeps on saying error. The facial recognition cannot recognized my face what the f I'm utterly disappointed for the inconvenience it has caused me.","678276":"It's been 3 yrs. since I tried to verify my account. Now my passport is expired, and can't cancel the verification. Back then I was going to cancel it but when I click it, it said \"we're verifying your account\". I wasn't even done in the process, I haven't even put my information but it still proceeded. I already submitted a ticket yet nothing change. The ai helper said my ticket was resolved in Jan. 2, 2024 but again nothing change. I don't know how long this will take, might just get a new no.","678361":"The most powerful e-wallet that you could ever imagine! The security features are great!","678570":"I've been using this app for a long time without encountering any problems, but now, I have to say that this app deserves a 1-star rating from me. I tried to send money to another account, but I encountered issues with the code delivery being slow and delayed. I waited almost all night but never received the code. I'm sorry to rate you 1 star this time; I'll change it back if everything gets resolved.","679065":"I am absolutely disgusted by your app. I did NOT change my device yet this Secure Account feature has locked me out. I'm using the same device I registered with! I already dealt with the awful verification process before and that was done but you give me another reason to hate this app every now and then! And you're holding everyone else's money hostage! This should be illegal! Get rid of the damn secure account feature! You should be sued for this!","679859":"I can't even make an account. I've been trying for days now, I've tried switching to mobile data and 3 different wifi connections in different places, tried tweaking the settings, restarting the phone and app, etc. but still nothing. all I get is \"Oops! please check your internet connection and try again.\" also, PLEASE remove gambling.","680412":"HORRIBLE APP. It's supposed to make online & cashless payments convenient, but it ends up giving me a lot of trouble in many cases. I've already lost count on how many times I have to register my phone IN TIMES I NEEDED TO DO TRANSACTIONS ASAP! It's so infuriating! And the updates! It's updating almost every week in the most inconvenient time, and I end up terminating my transactions! I hate that GCash is the most used cashless payment method in most facilities. I'd rather use another option if","680566":"This app has so many bugs. It kept saying that there is no internet connection even though both our WiFi and mobile data are running just fine. Browsing through the comments, I realized that I wasn't the only one experiencing this yet there hasn't been any progress regarding this concern. Do better! Many people subscribe to your app for convenience yet you only make things more inconvenient for them.","681065":"It's not fair that some student like me cannot use the app fully because of not having any of the valid ID's you required. Perhaps you shoukd let us verify also because I totally cannot send money or pay my bills because I can only use the basic version. You should be more considerate! Edit: 3 years later, there are still lots of bad things in the app. Edit (2): 4 years later, charged me twice for nothing. 2882 does not respond.","682431":"Fix your facial recognition! It says I need to check my internet connection when in reality it's on your end that is need checking! Very terrible, considering this is an e-wallet app that holds actual money and I can't even login to my account, this is a huge flaw! The problem has been around for weeks now and it hasn't been fixed. Very poor app! Edit: They fixed the facial recognition! All's good now!","682486":"Overall rating, 0. Got the worst experience in any online transaction with this app. It kept me fro using my money at my disposal since I previously had a verified account. The change from verified to basic account is so serious that I cannot use my money not even for any bank transfer. What's worst is the lack or inefficient coordination from this app for the verification of the accounts. Worst decision to invest money or keep money in this app.","682714":"I hate the fact that the first thing that greets me when I open the app is a useless advertisement that blocks majority of the screen each time. Instead of trying to make it more seamless as that should be the goals of applications, here comes this app that adds an additional tap to your experience. Pretty useless tap as it is just to get rid of useless information that gets shoved in your face. Everytime!","683932":"The ads are intrusive, the help screens that appear too often are a nuisance since they are not clearly different from the real Actions. In a rush I have often been pressing what I thought was an action only to find that it was actually part of the \"help\" screen. The feature creep\/bloat is unnecessary. Finally the almost universal convenience fees for cash-in reduces the convenience of the app. I have gone from using it frequently to barely using it now. Overall rating: barely adequate.","684704":"Ugh! I would never recommend GCash if your phone camera isn't good. It's like they expect everyone to have a top-notch camera! I know mine isn't the best, but I try everything - white background, good lighting - and it still says my pictures are unclear, distorted, or invalid. It feels like whoever's verifying is messing with me! I've tried verifying countless times, and it's getting stressful. Taking clear pictures is hard enough with my camera!","685718":"Hi! You may have experienced a delay with your GCash Bank Transfer due to an ongoing bank validation. Once your bank confirms the transaction, your funds will be reflected in your nominated bank account within 3-5 banking days. We apologize for the inconvenience. But 8 days before we have no text comfermation.. 2 weeks no txt confirmation","685727":"Charged with an unknown auto-debit transaction that I don't know how I have made a P1,450.00 transaction. Still gonna use this app even I have a huge loss of amount experience.","685746":"I recently downloaded this app with high hopes, but unfortunately, my experience has been quite disappointing. The app keeps crashing repeatedly, which makes it nearly impossible to use consistently. It's frustrating to encounter such technical issues, and it's hindering my ability to fully utilize the app's features. I've tried restarting my device and even clearing cache, but the problem persists.I would appreciate it if the developers could address this issue and provide a more stable exp.","685974":"too long to respond, cannot open by one tap, needs to tap multiple times before functioning, plus it doesn't seem helpful especially when you're on a hurry .. time consuming. (2weeks passed, I tried to open it, it does open after multiple times of tapping, afterwards when time of selecting the contact number of whom I will send money, it just turn out black after a moment then it restarts, then back to its menu\/home . Like what the F I've been doing it for almost 16 hrs and it's still the same!","686540":"Aside from being the slowest app ever existed, it says Verify Your Account even though I have been verified for a long time. And all of these issues happen when I have urgent transactions. Unreliable app. Feedback is still applicable. Plus, the app suddenly hang. And now I sent money to the wrong number. Of course, Gcash doesn't do refund valid or not.","686788":"If only theres a zero star option to rate this app. Very unreliable, always crashes and full of bugs. Cant even process a simple login setup. Been a user of the app for sometime now but still cant scan my face properly. Customer service takes too long to address your concern. No sense or urgency to provide \"convenience\" to the user. \"Ticket\" format of concerns doesnt really work because theres no fixing being done. Overall the experience has always been bad.","687596":"Absolutely requires tremendous work. I understand GCash would implement such tedious security feature, but given how there are no other options to work around to bypass this feature, it is almost impossible. It appears it won't let me in my account due to my device being 'unsecure'. For others having a hard time, I suggest having other e-wallets for the time being unless this is resolved.","687772":"I am not happy with the performance of the app. Whenever I try to navigate the paying of bills option it just leads me to nowhere. The app often lags and will redirect you to the home option. It will not let you do anything. In a nutshell, the app really needs to upgrade for the better. (This has been going on for months. \ud83d\udc80) Update, worst app ever. Please do better!","688008":"Sucks. I've been staring at my screen, permanently \"Processing\" like what in the actual heck are you processing for? Confidential national security mission or something? Cause I've been staring at my screen for the past 20 minutes and no \"process\" is actually happening. I've tried my internet connection with other E-Wallet apps and they worked just fine, better even. So internet connection problem is out on the window, it's just your app sucks when we needed it the most. Thank you","688282":"My phone is already registered but I can't login to my account. It just says something went wrong pls try again later. Un-installed\/reinstalled, switched wifi to data, clear cache\/clear data, off\/on phone. Same issue. Now, need to contact support to use a different phone. Update: I can login now! Edited the star review. Their response was so quick. Ticket said to wait for a day but it was just an hour or less I think. Thanks for the support.","688417":"I can't login to my account using the same device that I registered my account with. The recent update to limit device usage to just one is just plain stupid. When you encounter problems, you're basically out of options. Error message is also really freaking helpful \"something went wrong\". What's wrong is you, GCash, and your non-existent customer service.","688710":"Total and utter bloatware. Gcash goes from bad to worse with each update. Not only have to deal with the popup on log in, hanging on processing, black screens, and crashes, they have now changed how express send works. No longer can I type the first 3 letters of a contact in, its now quicker to input the number as searching for a contact in now crashes. Whoever is the cause of these problems should live out the rest of their life in a pain amplifier.","689055":"Been a great help on my online transactions, but after this additional security to register the phone, start to prompt, our system is detecting that your device is not secure. Not completing the online transactions. I tried to re-install the apps. and repeat required phone registration. Still, prompting, our system is detecting... Might as well stop using the apps. if the problem won't be fix...","689058":"Ever since my last update to this review, it has been a livid experience whenever I have to use your app or your other related app, since I mostly use this for on-the-spot emergencies where time is a factor. Performance is sluggish, UI\/UX is a grating mess. You may say it's \"just a minor\" inconveniennce, but it is vexing every time, enough for me to go at you with this review. I say this in comparison with one of your competitors, of which I have none of these issues.","689706":"The app is buggy. Sending money (470php) doesnt proceed, keeps on prompting to check my wallet balance and internet connection. Both has no problem (with enough wallet amount (900php) and 300mbps connection), and still doesnt proceed. Last week, it took me 2days of trying (just trying to sending money) until the transaction proceeded. Im a fully verified account. I've been trying since yesterday, and its getting really frustrating if this is the norm..","690355":"Gcash suddenly reverted my account from verified into basic. I tried updating my gcash information last year and it only said I need to wait for 7 days for the confirmation but what now? It's now almost half a year! I badly need to send money but I can't use the services now because it said my account needs to be verified! Please keep your promises and review the accounts as it's your job!","690403":"The app been very useful in many ways. But, perhaps the developer could device a lite version of the app where it could perform basic functionality or the user may be able to choose the kind function that fits their need upon installation. That way, simple Android user's need not to worry on the space it occupy on their phone. With its excessive updates, it is a bugger on a simple phone!","691105":"When it comes to Load and Store payments via electronic money transfer. Its really convenient, until it has been updated, that i cannot read the complete name of the sender, i hope it will be improve to the limit where we can choose if we want to show the name of the sender or be hidden. I hate it, aside from that the limitations of a hundred thousand is so dumb. Coz when it reaches out to the limit we or someone could not send the transaction she wants to send","691124":"I've downloaded it but at this point it's just taking up space on my phone. Please fix the verification process. I've tried several times but it just doesn't work. It takes too long. First, it says that my id picture was blurry even though it wasn't. Second, the app makes the selfie come out blurry. When I take photos with my phone it looks fine. I suggest having the option of simply uploading photos from the gallery as the app's scanner takes too long and is terrible.","692137":"USEFUL IN SOME WAYS BUT.... *TOO MANY UPDATES *NEEDS GOOD INTERNET CONNECTION TO LOG IN AND NEEDS TO DO IT MORE THAN ONCE *HARD TO BUY LOAD, KEEPS LOADING THE PAGE! THAT IS WHY I AM HESITANT TO STORE MONEY HERE AND GET THAT VISA CARD!","692256":"this app need to fix the verification system, I've encounter it when verifying my account; when filling up the information that necessary and then suddenly you accidentally tap it back, then all of a sudden the progress will disappear when you fill up the information, then even you're progress is still incomplete it will automatically send. That's why it's hard to create an account here, it's my account that I want to verify , until now it has not been verified because of the system that app has","694079":"It's unnecessarily tedious when you need to switch accounts as the app only works for ONE DEVICE. The whole photo requirement for securing a device takes too long, especially when you're switching devices on the spot (and that's on top of 2F authentication and a pin code) There are also a bunch of unnecessary ads and tutorials that slow the entire process of paying, especially here in the PH where internet isn't always at its best.","694083":"I'm tired of this verification processes. This is just trash! I've been to many places, on to many angles but it wouldn't read the i.d. to be scanned, the app is slow to unaccessible, this is bugged. I hope the developer would take a peak on these reviews. might as well change to their competition e-wallet apps. i miss the old gcash.","695615":"Your apps SUCKS!! Period. I was fully verified and also have investments in gfunds. Mind you, I go through all the process and steps in order to get fully verified and to be allowed to invest and what happens next? I got log out of my account then force me to login using this face recognition that never ever works. Logout of my account for more than 1 MONTH now. Have my ticket since day 1 and still no progress. Dont install this app. If only there is zero rating. VERY FRUSTRATING!!!","695715":"Very useful and helpful but: 1. Cannot be trusted. It has sent a payment 2x (exactly same timestamp so it wasnt my mistake). Good thing, it was sent to a friend, who returned it. 2. Not reliable. Can be buggy. 3. Takes a long time to open the app and there's always a pop up\/advertisement every time you log in. 4. My account got frozen even after I finished updating my KYC. Verification process took longer than indicated.","696251":"Considering how many people forget the end of their subscription, it would be helpful to notify the user if they want to renew the plan or cancel it rather than getting a notification that oir hard earned money was already deducted from a subscription that will end tomorrow, this just sucks. Worst app It got worse, the constant verification you need to do every transaction is very inconvenient and inefficient. Plus the one phone policy is irritating.","696519":"In the first place, it's very unreliable as it's not accredited by the BSP. Then it has bad verification system especially with the ID and Face verification. I already used 4 of my IDs, and it still wasn't able to read my middle name. This is very crucial especially when you're changing phones, since their new feature only lets you use one phone for your account. So, you need those verifications to unregister your old phone and register your new phone. It also has a lot of bugging issues.","696947":"Seems to be working again, I still need to check on a few features to be sure, before I trust the app.","697302":"Fast transaction, establishments are GCash-ready so widely used as to avoid hip-hops and long travel. No more sukli sukli just card scan or account typing.","698620":"Verification process sucks!! I've been trying to verify my information since last year but nothing happens!! I can't even use this app for anything!! Change the ID verification process include secondary ID's just like with pay maya. another thing, why it always crash due to unsecure device error message what was that?! You need to improve everything and make it more user friendly!!","699229":"The face ID has a lot of bugs. Even though I'm doing what the instructions say, it won't work. I got it once, but it shown me the face ID page once again. I have been working on this for almost a whole day and my face is still not recognized. This really annoys me, and it just repeats what i have to do all over again. Please fix this, i can't log into my account because of this. And i have money in-stored there too.","699498":"well, it doesn't let me verify my account. when i try to submit my national I.D. it says too many attempt, then when its face scan, it fails. everytime I try to verify my account, there comes some issues like this. you need yo clear this up. this app is supposed to make things convenient. but it shows cases the other way around causing us to have problems. it sucks. and every transaction I made, it says system security kemerut and then it automatically log out\/back itself causing me to problems.","699973":"On every update requires you to set up your account all over again (sending again valid ID, additional infos, and selfie). Worst part, you'll have to wait for week\/s to get the confirmation. You are not able to send out money or load because you have to wait for your account to be verified. Honestly, I could not find significant changes on every update except it gets glitching than before. Online payments were supposed to be more efficient and convenient to use. This was not.

And now, there's even a fee if you're loading even if it's to Globe or your own account! Talk about greedy... Edit: Talking about greedy!

Anong klaseng systema yun?!!! Bwiset!","700969":"I keep getting the 90 day expired code thing. It is annoying. Still keeps asking me for authentication. It's not even 90 days as I just did it 2 weeks ago.","701240":"The worst app ever. Account secure is a trash feature! You can't use your money whenever you need it the most! If you lost your phone, you can't access your money especially when there is an emergency. The Bank Transfer feature is not working. The Express Send Feature is not working too. The worst app ever. GCash is not trustworthy because your money is not safe.","701258":"I've been using this app for years. No hassle. These days, it doesn't open fast or open at all most of the time, always saying \"SOMETHING WENT WRONG \" or learn to trouble shoot. I use this app for most of my online transactions.

Afterall your app are full of bugs, not to mention some features that actually isn't helpful at all such as turning off the developer options.

And even if those are resolved it isn't guaranteed that you will finish your transaction successful because your app sucks.","702851":"Very bad experience, it's been almost a year I'm trying to verify my account, I tried several times and I created a ticket but nothing help, Customer service are useless. Fix your eKYC or open a physical store to enroll users if you can't verify your customers through the app. Every time I get a message that I wasn't verified because of the face recognition or id doesn't match.

THIS APP IS WORST AND THE DEVELOPERS ARE BUNCH OF JUNIOR DEVS WHO CODE WITH CHATGPT.","703872":"The face recognition feature in the app is unreliable. My attempts to log in, switch devices, and register a new phone have been consistently unsuccessful due to face verification errors.

This creates a frustrating user experience where issues remain unaddressed. Please investigate this issue thoroughly and implement a permanent solution.","703974":"ever since the new update about 'phone security' has been added, the app keeps on being horrible. 1. The app always closes as they keep on saying that the 'phone is not secure'. I have restsrted my phone, have a 16 digit password and is on a private wifi connection and it still doesn't work. 2. The fact that it also doesn't allow Developer Mode to be enabled makes it worse.","704080":"Gcash was a great app before but now it became unusable. Its on maintenance again.

One of the first things I do. Disappointing that Gcash prohibits this. I will refrain from using your app. Overly restrictive! And what happens if you lose your phone? The new \"security feature\" is going to lock you out. I will uninstall your garbage app.","705425":"This app was reliable at first,, but as the time passed.. More and more issues popped up! It kept telling me my phone was unsecure despite it being verified... In addition, I couldn't even get to log in my account as the face regnition feature wouldn't even work. I've had too many attempts here, I am losing my patience. I have already reported this issue and Is till haven't gotten a response... This just makes the app from convenient to totally useless to me.. mind you my account was verified..","705996":"The biggest problem for most people is getting verified. Either very easy or very difficult. It's a good app but two annoying features. Firstly the crassy ads which you have to dismiss every time you log in. Sort of thing you expect from a free game app, not a serious financial institution. For OTP verification you get two paragraphs telling you that this is probably a scam and then it finally says if you were actually meaning to send money here's the code. Very unprofessional compared to Maya.","706265":"The report or feedback system is not that user friendly. Also, the reports or problems are not fixed or accomodated immediately. Some of the problems are moneys are not received by the reciever but it will appear to the sender as sent. It will appear on the transaction history of the sender but not in the receiver. And its not only me who had experienced it.","706501":"I used to like this app. But w\/ the new update im having trouble verifying my account. Im already verified but w\/ their new system it ask me to update & take another ID for verification... Though Whenever i a take picture it will only says TOO MANY ATTEMPTS even its my 1st time taking a scan.. Developers u always update the apps interface but never mindful w\/ the users problems\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\udc4e","706994":"I don't like their service. No agent to call when you need help about your problem in their app. Since they updated their app, I couldn't receive an authentication code even an OTP number to access transferring money in another account. I tried all the troubleshoot they suggested, not even one work. I regret using this app for money transfer and saving. They're the worst! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","707001":"Gcash, what is going on with your app? I can't receive 6 digit code when I try to log in my number. Can this be fixed as I have auto debit for my bills! So inconvenient.","707169":"QR scanners are inconsistent, and annoyingly every now and then, the app won't open. And the need to unregister before deleting the account us absurd. How can people unregister on the app, when the app itself is the problem and won't open? I am very dissatisfied with the app. Every now and then there's always an error or a problem. QRs won't work, everytime I open the app it has so many errors. Please, do better.","707338":"Fix your app! Everytime i need to cash-in, the app unenrolls my linked card account. Such a hassle and inconvenience. Never gotten better EVER SINCE! Edit: the device security is stupid and unnecessary, i login with my fingerprint everytime how come it's not safe when i do that? Does it even make sense?!?!","707577":"Please put a feature wherein you could change registered device to another phone. The thing is, when someone broke their phone but still retained the sim, they're pretty much effed up. You can't use your account anymore as there is no option on the app that lets you change devices on another phone. You can't even raise a ticket for it as it forces you to deactivate your account. Tried calling 2882 but to bo avail, only passes you up to raising a ticket using the app(which the app has no option)","708293":"I've had a terrible experience with GCash. The app struggles to scan my ID properly, which is incredibly frustrating. It also takes way too long to load, and the UI performance is garbage. The app feels sluggish and unresponsive. Overall, not worth the hassle. Fix these issues, GCash!","708317":"Security was never updated, they just want our phones as default as it can be. It will not open if you customized your phone with \"developer options\" or if any app can install an apk to your phone. Now with it's latest patch, if you open a chat head from messenger, it will force close. If that last one is a bug, sure, it's fixable, if it's a feature, it's useless and a hassle. Real devs don't do circus.","708342":"Although i have conducted some online transactions through the app of which i have no qualms in the past.The Verification process is too much of a hassle.gave up after 3 tries of trying to verify my Gcash account only to receive that \"The ID you've sent is too distorted, blurry, or invalid\" it would have simple if you let your user send their ID picture themselves rather than using your \"scanner\" of which i would describe as \"finicky and very delicate\".Update:resorted using other ID which worked","709295":"JULY 2 UPDATE is a mess up, it stopped supporting Android 14 but works on very old versions of android","709354":"Can't you guys hire a better IT personnel who can fix your laggy app. It's close to unusable. There are plenty of services being added but man the laggish experience is unbearable. Would rate the app alone a zero.","709433":"please do notify the users if you're going to have a maintenance. I can't open my account, I installed and re-installed. I waited more than 30 mins and still nothing happens? pls fix this issue, I cannot continue with my transaction bcs I cannot open my account it keeps on loading and processing.","710176":"New UI but the scrolling speed still feels like 30hz.","710417":"I love this app, but lately, it's become 'too secure' that it will not let me do most of my transactions, and now it will not even let me access my own account. It always says, \"The device you are using is not secure.\" Clear the cache and data, uninstall and reinstall the app, and nothing works. Instead of showing a vague error, it might be better if you just included a disclaimer during setup about the potential risk of running the app on certain devices or settings.","711472":"This app is messed up. I can't even go to my dashboard, after putting in my MPIN the processing screen shows up and just loads forever. Also tried various solutions like uninstalling the app, force stop, clearing cache and still nothing works. For some reason, the app works like normal in the morning and at night the same problem occurs again.","711931":"The first experience was good, it went very well from creating my account to when I cash out the money that my parents sent me, until one night I tried to log in but the processing takes long so I tried it again until the next morning. When I log in again, it says that I need to troubleshoot so I followed all steps on how to recover my account but it seems none of them are working. I have already send 3 tickets about these issue but they didn't respond my concern. Up until now, I couldnt log in.","712554":"\"Enjoy a faster commute.\" Not even close. App takes multiple taps to be opened and when you do it'll say that something's wrong when clearly there isn't. If a single opened program that overlays your screen (i.e; Messenger chat heads, Smart Sidebar, etc.) then expect your experience to be thrice as hard since it'll close the app instantly which can either make your transactions not work or can make you do wrongful transactions. Bank transfers are inactive when they're a \"BANKING\" app.","713331":"It's frustrating, the app suddenly disappear from the drawer. It also keep saying that, my device is not secured even though I don't have or own any harmful application and my device is fully secured. It also said that, for me to be protected, the app is needed to be closed. It's getting annoying, I've tried to shutdown my device hoping that it go back to normal but it didn't. I've tried to login multiple times but I keep getting the same result. Do your thing please!!","713406":"This app work well fast and perfect, reliable all the time. The function is very fast and very useful.I request that you further improve the service provided. Many people trust you. In all the problems you will face from negative thoughts, openion.I hope you will be strong.I hope that what needs to be fixed is fixed. Their insults that gcash doesn't work well is probably because their cellphones are old and broken. Need to buy a new one. Good day everyone!!!","713519":"Using it is not helpful at all. Gotta need to uninstall then reinstall the app to make it function properly. Commuting to bayad center is faster than waiting and waiting then opening-reopening the app just to pay a single bill. Then sending money has never been this annoying, I've been trying to send a send and it just kept on telling \"unstable internet\" I've switch from wifi to data and it's still the same while my brother be having a great gameplay beside me, we both are using the same wifi.","713673":"Unable to launch or access the app. Is there something wrong with it? Switched off \/ on and even restarted my phone still unable to get to the screen where you need to put your MPIN. Cleared cache and data, force stop the app, uninstalled and reinstalled the app. App stopped working on my phone. What's going on? Please FIX THIS RIGHT AWAY PLEASE.
